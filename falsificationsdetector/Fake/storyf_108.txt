Three women who all went missing in the mid-1970s have turned up, at least parts of them, in a steel industrial 55-gallon drum buried on the Clinton estate in Chappaqua, New York. The barrel, which contained the arms, legs and heads of the three women, was filled with what the medical examiner calls a “crude preservative.”
That means that whoever put them in there wanted to be able to visit them later. Investigators were hoping to find the torsos in the second barrel recovered but found nothing but women’s shoes inside, all brand new in boxes withy the tags still on them. One investigator called it “the weirdest thing he’s ever seen.”
The three women, all of whom were in their late teens or early 20s, were hitchhiking their way from California to New York in 1974 when they disappeared. Their last known location before heading back onto the road was a motel just outside of Little Rock.
Is it a coincidence that three pretty young girls who disappeared so long ago from Arkansas ended up dead and buried on a property in upstate New York? It does if you talk to the Clintons PR people:
“Bill and Hillary Clinton have nothing to do with this and welcome any investigation with open arms. They have offered the DOJ their full cooperation. You people and your conspiracy theories that everyone who dies in America must have had a run-in with Hillary or Bill Clinton need to sit down.”
Investigators say while they don’t yet have enough to charge Bill Clinton, they certainly have enough evidence to question him. When they approached the house to do their jobs, they were met by a team of lawyers and Secret Service personnel and told that unless they have some real evidence, Mr. Clinton was unavailable.
They added that he felt really bad for those girls but hoped at least now their families have closure. Clinton will use ignorance and the 5th amendment to once again try to get away with murder.

Unlike classic espionage, which involves the collection of foreign secrets, active measures aim at influencing events\u2014at undermining a rival power with forgeries, front groups, and countless other techniques honed during the Cold War. The Soviet leadership considered Reagan an implacable militarist. According to extensive notes made by Vasili Mitrokhin, a high-ranking K.G.B. officer and archivist who later defected to Great Britain, Soviet intelligence tried to infiltrate the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic National Committees, popularize the slogan \u201cReagan Means War!,\u201d and discredit the President as a corrupt servant of the military-industrial complex. The effort had no evident effect. Reagan won forty-nine of fifty states.\r\rActive measures were used by both sides throughout the Cold War. In the nineteen-sixties, Soviet intelligence officers spread a rumor that the U.S. government was involved in the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. In the eighties, they spread the rumor that American intelligence had \u201ccreated\u201d the AIDS virus, at Fort Detrick, Maryland. They regularly lent support to leftist parties and insurgencies. The C.I.A., for its part, worked to overthrow regimes in Iran, Cuba, Haiti, Brazil, Chile, and Panama. It used cash payments, propaganda, and sometimes violent measures to sway elections away from leftist parties in Italy, Guatemala, Indonesia, South Vietnam, and Nicaragua. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in the early nineties, the C.I.A. asked Russia to abandon active measures to spread disinformation that could harm the U.S. Russia promised to do so.

But not to fear! I have a simple tip that\u2019s guaranteed to pick you up and get you back in good spirits in no time, and here it is: Whenever you\u2019re feeling low, just remember that I, Donald Trump, will be dead in roughly 15 to 20 years.\r\rThat\u2019s right. In the not-very-distant future I will die and then be gone from the world for all eternity. You may even get to watch me in a casket on national television being lowered into the ground, never to be seen again. I bet you\u2019re smiling just thinking about that.\r\rNow, I recognize that the news out there in the world has been particularly depressing lately, and these days it\u2019s understandable that one might begin to feel like there\u2019s no hope and no reason to go on, but let me assure you that there is. Oh, boy, is there ever! Indeed, you can always take solace in the fact that the monstrous, unimaginable piece of shit that is me will stop existing fairly soon, and that I will continue to not exist for the remainder of your lifetime. Biologically speaking, I, the host of NBC\u2019s The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, have no more than two decades left to live. In fact, right now I\u2019m just 10 years away from reaching the average lifespan of an American male.\r\rHow does that make you feel? Pretty good, right?\rSure, I\u2019ll have a grand, opulent funeral that will be talked about and broadcast extensively, and all the news segment retrospectives on my life will probably be obnoxious to watch and listen to, and will very likely make you angry. But just think: all of those segments will end with a picture of my blustery, self-important face and the dates 1946\u20132031 printed beneath it. Or maybe 1946\u20132032. Or, who knows, maybe earlier! Even if you\u2019re not feeling glum, I guarantee the recognition that my death is a concrete and rapidly approaching inevitability will make you feel even better.\r\rAnd if my death in 15 or 20 years feels like it\u2019s too far in the future to wash away your blues, you can take heart knowing that I\u2019ll start to physically and mentally deteriorate well before then. Why, by 2020, I, a man who recently tried to extort the sitting president of the United States to release his college and passport records, might even begin to show signs of serious and unavoidable decline in mental and physical faculties, and doesn\u2019t that just perk your spirits right up?""]",1,1,16/03/2017,"0    http://www.theonion.com/blogpost/when-youre-fe...

Hallihan said it\u2019s this commitment to innovation that allows his company to always provide its clients with the next ingenious product that has already been in use for quite some time.\r\r\u201cPart of what makes us such trailblazers is our willingness to completely scrap what we\u2019re doing right now in favor of a strategy that\u2019s been fairly ubiquitous since 2013,\u201d said Hallihan, noting that he hopes a recent rollout of real-time bidding and ad exchange platforms will place DigiVista firmly atop the list of leading marketing firms of the beginning of the decade. \u201cOur creative focus on methods developed by other companies is what\u2019s going to drive our business right to where the vanguard of this industry used to be.\u201d\r\r\u201cYeah, sometimes we have to push the envelope on what could be done in 2010, but we don\u2019t know any other way around here,\u201d he added.\r\rHallihan hinted that DigiVista is preparing to disrupt the marketing world once more, this time by proactively embracing original concepts that its competitors put in place just 12 to 18 months ago. But he said such a gambit should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the company\u2019s history of taking substantial risks to adopt the very same business plans that other, more successful firms were using just a short while back.']",1,1,16/03/2017,"0   NaN

Bernie Sanders primary campaign, chose the Golden State for its most robust outlay since Election Day.\rThe western front\rCalifornia legislators passed a single-payer bill in 2006, but Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it. Similar efforts have stalled out at earlier stages. Those efforts, however, did not have the emerging Sanders operation -- with an estimated 300,000 supporters in California alone -- working as an engine room dedicated to driving popular support.\rThe current political leadership is expected to be more welcoming this time around. Gov. Jerry Brown is a Democrat and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the leading candidates to succeed Brown after he is termed out next year, recently said he planned to introduce his own universal health care program.\rOrganizers also point to the fight over Obamacare, and the specter of an overhaul authored by Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, as a potentially powerful motivator.\r ']",0,0,18/03/2017,"0   NaN

Meanwhile, higher prices are luring American shale producers back into the market.\rOPEC production dropped by 139,500 barrels during the month, according to the group's monthly report.

That's roughly 500,000 barrels a day below the level OPEC pledged to cut production as part of a six month agreement with other major producers including Russia.\rThe agreement to cut production, which took effect in January, is designed to support prices by limiting supply.\rThere are reasons, however, to think the plan is on shaky ground. Higher prices have in recent months helped to lure American shale producers back into the market and some OPEC members have continued to pump above their quota.\rRelated: Massive oil discovery in Alaska is biggest onshore find in 30 years\rU.S. crude production been growing steadily, topping more than 9 million barrels a day in February, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That would drive prices lower and make U.S. shale operations unprofitable. But it also risks sharply reducing revenue for oil-dependent member states.\rRelated: Oil, arms, tech: Trump and Saudi prince have a lot to discuss\rThe more conventional course would be for OPEC to slash its own production to reduce the supply glut. That, however, would mean convincing Iran and Iraq to throttle back production at a time when they're loathe to do so.\rPrices are already moving.

He was 90.\r\rThe St. Charles County Police Department in Missouri confirmed his death on its Facebook page. Mr. Berry died at his home near Wentzville, Mo., about 45 miles west of St. Louis. The department said it responded to a medical emergency and he was declared dead after lifesaving measures were unsuccessful.\r\rWhile Elvis Presley was rock\u2019s first pop star and teenage heartthrob, Mr. Berry was its master theorist and conceptual genius, the songwriter who understood what the kids wanted before they knew themselves. With songs like \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and \u201cRoll Over Beethoven,\u201d he gave his listeners more than they knew they were getting from jukebox entertainment.\r\rHis guitar lines wired the lean twang of country and the bite of the blues into phrases with both a streamlined trajectory and a long memory. And tucked into the lighthearted, telegraphic narratives that he sang with such clear enunciation was a sly defiance, upending convention to claim the pleasures of the moment.\r\rContinue reading the main story\r\rRELATED COVERAGE\r\r\r15 Essential Chuck Berry Songs MARCH 19, 2017\rAdvertisement\r\rContinue reading the main story\rIn \u201cSweet Little Sixteen,\u201d \u201cYou Can\u2019t Catch Me\u201d and other songs, Mr. Berry invented rock as a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit).

One of them is Judge John Kane, currently a senior judge in the US District of Colorado, where Gorsuch lives.\rThe Democrats on the committee are also putting forward witnesses, many of whom are representatives from nonprofit groups, including the Sierra Club and the National Women\'s Law Center.\rAnother witness is Jeff Perkins, whose son with autism was at the heart of a lawsuit resulting in a high-profile interpretation by Gorsuch in his current role as a federal judge for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.\rThat interpretation was reversed by the Supreme Court on Wednesday and it became a topic of questioning by Democrats in Gorsuch\'s hearing.']",0,0,23/03/2017,http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/politics/neil-gorsuch-filibuster-witness-hearing/index.html

For all the numbers \u2026, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, \u2026, see Integer.\rNatural numbers can be used for counting (one apple, two apples, three apples, \u2026)\rReal numbers (R) include the rational (Q), which include the integers (Z), which include the natural numbers (N)\r\rIn mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in ""there are six coins on the table"") and ordering (as in ""this is the third largest city in the country""). In common language, words used for counting are ""cardinal numbers"" and words used for ordering are ""ordinal numbers"".\r\rSome definitions, including the standard ISO 80000-2,[1] begin the natural numbers with 0, corresponding to the non-negative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026, whereas others start with 1, corresponding to the positive integers 1, 2, 3, \u2026.[2][3][4][5] Texts that exclude zero from the natural numbers sometimes refer to the natural numbers together with zero as the whole numbers, but in other writings, that term is used instead for the integers (including negative integers).\r\rThe natural numbers are the basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension: the integers, by including (if not yet in) the neutral element and an additive inverse (\u2212n) for each natural number n (and zero, if it is not there already, as its own additive inverse); the rational numbers, by including a multiplicative inverse (1/n) for each nonzero integer n; the real numbers by including with the rationals the (converging) Cauchy sequences of rationals; the complex numbers, by including with the real numbers the unresolved square root of minus one; and so on.[6][7] These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded (identified) in the other number systems.\r\rProperties of the natural numbers, such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers, are studied in number theory. Problems concerning counting and ordering, such as partitioning and enumerations, are studied in combinatorics.\r\rIn common language, for example in primary school, natural numbers may be called counting numbers[8] both to intuitively exclude the negative integers and zero, and also to contrast the discreteness of counting to the continuity of measurement, established by the real numbers.\r\rThe natural numbers can, at times, appear as a convenient set of names (labels), that is, as what linguists call nominal numbers, foregoing ']",0,0,23/03/2017,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number

Some attribute this change to the fact that millions of Americans are now receiving help from the law just as Republicans are poised to dismantle it.\r\rThis is part of an ongoing series by CNN\'s John Blake and Tawanda Scott Sambou on race, religion and politics\rBut others cite another factor: The face of Obamacare is now white.\r\rMore Americans now realize Obamacare helps millions of working class whites and that it\'s not -- as once portrayed by conservatives -- a form of welfare pushed by the first black president to help people of color, historians and scholars say.

Some attribute this change to the fact that millions of Americans are now receiving help from the law just as Republicans are poised to dismantle it.\r\rThis is part of an ongoing series by CNN\'s John Blake and Tawanda Scott Sambou on race, religion and politics\rBut others cite another factor: The face of Obamacare is now white.\r\rMore Americans now realize Obamacare helps millions of working class whites and that it\'s not -- as once portrayed by conservatives -- a form of welfare pushed by the first black president to help people of color, historians and scholars say.

""I\'m as frustrated as anyone. You can\'t read a single thing that\'s been highlighted.

""But now we\'ll never know for sure.""\r\rIn addition to clouding the historical record, the use of the black highlighters, also known as ""permanent markers,"" may have encumbered or even prevented critical operations. CIA scholar Matthew Franks was forced to abandon work on a book about the Bay Of Pigs invasion after declassified documents proved nearly impossible to read.\r\r""With all the highlighting in the documents I unearthed in the National Archives, it\'s really no wonder that the invasion failed,"" Franks said. ""I don\'t see how the field operatives and commandos were expected to decipher their orders.""\r\rThe inspector general\'s report cited in particular the damage black highlighting did to documents concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy, thousands of pages of which ""are completely highlighted, from top to bottom margin.""\r\r""It is unclear exactly why CIA bureaucrats sometimes chose to emphasize entire documents,"" the report read.

""If we\'re going to dig ourselves out of this mess, Americans need to stop wearing blue jeans to interviews, even if they\'re nice blue jeans, and even if that particular office happens to have a relaxed dress code.""\r\r""They also need to start bringing extra copies of their resum\xe9s, as it will show they are prepared and serious,"" Solis added. ""And, by the way, how hard is it to send a hand-written thank-you note afterward? Anyone can dash off an e-mail.""\r\rA federal survey of employers found that nearly half of job-seeking Americans botched their interviews by responding no when asked, ""So, do you have any questions for me?"" Among candidates strongly qualified to perform the jobs they were applying for, 36 percent didn\'t bring a notepad or pen to the interview, and 16 percent were thrown off guard when the interviewer broached topics unrelated to work, such as the weather, sports, or personal hobbies.\r\rTwelve percent, employers said, did this kind of nervous throat-clearing thing.\r\r""If applicants would just say yes when asked if they played softball or liked golf, we could add 350,000 jobs to the private sector,"" Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris said. ""The fact is, right now, today, approximately a third of the country\'s manufacturing positions are vacant. Auto plants across the country, especially in Detroit, are sitting there just waiting for people to come in and build cars.""\r\r""You may be a qualified candidate, but none of that matters if you walk into that interview lacking confidence,"" he added.

While some dashboards do not require frequent updates as the data doesn't change very often or even rarely, other dashboards may require constant updates, because its data changes at a very fast pace. Therefore, we can classify our dashboards into two main groups:\r\n\r\nAnalitics: usually focused on the analysis of information about the past (historical/statistics), or about information that is known in advance (forecasts). The main trait of these dashboards is that data does not change very often and the time frame is usually long. Some examples: A company's sales evolution and forecast, sport statistics in general, etc.\r\n\r\nReal time: their main trait is that data changes at a very fast pace. Therefore, this requires to update the indicators & reflect the changes in the UI frequently. Usually, the data is bound to a very short time frame, such as the last 10 seconds. Real time dashboards are typically used to monitor critical resources or systems, for example: Health display sensors, IT resources, air traffic control, etc. \r\n\r\n   Here is a comparison table which summarizes the main features of both:\r\n\r\n   \t Analytics \t Real-time  \r\n Data changes very often                              \t  No\t Yes   \r\n Time frame  \t  Any\t  Short   \r\n Amount of information  \t  Any\t  Little   \r\n Dashboard updates\t  Rarely\t  Frequent   \r\n\r\n\r\n  Dashbuilder is a general purpose dashboard solution.

And if left untreated over an entire four-year term, they could develop into more serious conditions that will end up costing taxpayers much more in the long run.\u201d The report also acknowledged, however, that Trump-related anxiety would result in billions of dollars in savings for elder care due to the shortened lifespan of many seniors.']",1,1,07/04/2017,none provided

Name: First Name, dtype: float64","[u'A 130-Year-Old Fact About Dinosaurs Might Be WrongWhen I first read Matthew Baron\u2019s new dinosaur study, I actually gasped.\r\rFor most of my life, I\u2019ve believed that the dinosaurs fell into two major groups: the lizard-hipped saurischians, which included the meat-eating theropods like Tyrannosaurus and long-necked sauropodomorphs like Brontosaurus; and the bird-hipped ornithischians, which included horned species like Triceratops and armored ones like Stegosaurus. That\u2019s how dinosaurs have been divided since 1887. It\u2019s what I learned as a kid. It\u2019s what all the textbooks and museums have always said. And according to Baron, a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, it\u2019s wrong.\r\rBy thoroughly comparing 74 early dinosaurs and their relatives, Baron has radically redrawn the two major branches of the dinosaur family tree. Defying 130 years of accepted dogma, he splits the saurischians apart, leaving the sauropods in one branch, and placing the theropods with the ornthischians on the other.

The split between saurischians and ornithischians was first proposed in 1887 by British paleontologist Harry Seeley, who divided the groups based on the shape of their hips\u2014a seductively obvious difference. \u201cWhen you look at specimens, it\u2019s very quick and easy to say: that\u2019s a saurischian, that\u2019s an ornithischian, and never the two shall meet,\u201d says Baron. \u201cPeople then go into their studies with that mindset, and Seeley\u2019s idea has never been rigorously tested.\u201d\r\rThat\u2019s not to say that previous researchers did sloppy science.

It\u2019s a collection of stones about 20 feet high, topped with a cross and decorated with gifts left by visitors\u2014pennies, feathers, shells, fluffy stuffed animals, and tiny tea candles. The stones bear the words in stark white lettering: \u201cMaggie Wall burnt here 1657 as a witch.\u201d\rScotland was home to nearly 3,800 people accused of witchcraft between 1500s and 1700s, the vast majority of whom were women. In the end, about 1,500 were murdered as a result of witch hunt acquisitions. However, mysteriously, there is no record of a woman named Maggie Wall being tried as a witch. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s no record of the monument itself until 1866, though a forest surrounding the monument called Maggie Walls Wood was documented as of 1829.\r\rSome claim that Maggie Wall did exist, her records simply didn\u2019t. Some locals theorize that a member of the Rollos, a powerful family that lived in Duncrub Castle, had an affair with Maggie Wall and built the monument out of guilt. Another theory is that Maggie was a part of a backlash against a group of officials trying to elect a new local minister. The group was attacked by a hoard of women, and some believe Maggie could have been singled out and punished.\r\rThe accepted theory is that this monument stands as a testament to all the witches murdered in Scotland during the witch hunts as no other such monument exists. Perhaps the name was taken from the surrounding wood to represent the countless and forgotten women who were killed. Occasionally a wreath is laid at the foot of the monument, serving as a reminder of the injustices suffered by the mysterious symbolic witch, Maggie Wall.

This allowed him to achieve his striking photographic results in a land of overwhelming light and heat. This so-called collodion process had to be completed within 15 minutes as well, which added a layer of drama to the proceedings.\rFrancis Frith\'s resulting photographs received such wide acclaim that he returned to Palestine, Syria, and Egypt twice before 1860, traveling farther up the Nile than any shutterbug before him. His pioneer spirit in this regard was a valuable commodity in the mid-19th century West, when photographic ""proof"" of the Holy Land was in high demand.\rWhether it was the Holy Land or elsewhere, Frith believed that photographs could capture the essence of a space unlike any other medium. Photographs, Frith said, could achieve ""far beyond anything that is in the power of the most accomplished artist to transfer to his canvas.""\rFrith\'s success as a commercial photographer enabled him to establish F. Frith & Co., which specialized in postcards of Britain and the Middle East. After years of enduring ""smothering little tents"" to build his company and his legacy, Frith switched gears to a managerial role.\rHis new project involved photographing every notable and historic site in the United Kingdom, a project that required hiring additional photographers. Combined with his postcards of the Holy Land, Frith built a company that his family ran until 1971.\rThe gallery above is a digital alternative to flipping through these Victorian-era photos depicting a mix of Old Testament sites and Egyptian ruins in striking, sandy sepia tones.']",1,0,13/04/2017,http://all-that-is-interesting.com/francis-frith-photographs

Siegel said he\'s demanding that the city release documents showing what procedures were followed.\r\rArtist Kristen Visbal\'s figure was first placed on a traffic island near Wall Street on March 7, on the eve of International Women\'s Day, to make a point: There\'s a dearth of women on the boards of the largest U.S. corporations.\rThe 4-foot girl staring down the 11-foot bull with hands planted on her hips quickly became a tourist magnet, drawing global attention on social media while awakening the imaginations of live visitors who posed for pictures. In response to petitions with tens of thousands of signatures for the statue to stay longer, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city permit was extended for nearly one year.\r\rDi Modica calls the statue an ""advertising trick"" created by two corporate giants \u2014 State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, and McCann, its New York advertising firm.\r\rThe Italian-born sculptor says the presence of Fearless Girl infringes on his own artistic copyright to the Charging Bull, by changing the creative dynamic to include the other bold presence.\r\rA spokeswoman for the mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\rThere was a time when Charging Bull was in a position similar to the Fearless Girl \u2014 waiting for the city to allow the piece to stay.\r\rDi Modica had installed the massive bronze in front of the New York Stock Exchange after the 1987 stock market crash, without a permit in the middle of the night \u2014 as a symbol of America\'s financial resilience. The city eventually responded to the public clamouring for the artwork to be allowed to remain in the Financial District, steps from Wall Street.\r\rThe sculptor came to him about 10 days ago, said Siegel, the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union handling the case with attorney Steven Hyman.\r\rA lawsuit has not been filed, said Siegel, who declined to say whether or when that might happen.']",0,0,13/04/2017,http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/charging-bull-wall-street-fearless-girl-1.4044555

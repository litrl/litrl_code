1,0,"On the debate stage, Jeb Bush has committed the sin of over-explanation,answering a pithy 1994 attack on his business career with so many detailsabout leases and debts that a baffled crowd erupted into boos.He has delivered high-minded put-downs, promising in a 1998 face-off toestablish a charter school ...for people that distort the facts.. and mischievouslyguaranteeing admission to his opponent.And he has mangled seemingly simple sentences, vowing in a 2002confrontation that ...we can make Florida a bright -  have a brighter future for-  for all Floridians...In a Republican presidential debate season dominated by glibshowmanship and volcanic personality, Mr. Bush, the former governor ofFlorida, faces a daunting challenge: How can he excite primary voters duringWednesday's televised rumpus with a sober and cerebral style that can appeartepid next to the insult-spraying, nuance-avoidant, made-for-TV manner ofDonald J. Trump?Now, after failing to directly confront Mr. Trump, the current frontrunner,during the first debate, Mr. Bush and his aides are under pressure tocreate a memorable showdown with the real estate developer to match a newlyaggressive tone on the campaign trail.Since the first debate, Mr. Bush has mocked Mr. Trump's immigrationplan as ...unrealistic,.. released a biting online ad that captures Mr. Trumppraising Hillary Rodham Clinton and accused Mr. Trump of trying to ...insulthis way to the presidency...In rigorous practice sessions that have crisscrossed the country in the pastfew weeks, Mr. Bush has been preparing pointed responses to Mr. Trump'smost frequent insults (he has called Mr. Bush ...low energy.. and a slave todonors) and crafting lines of attack on Mr. Trump's history of liberalstatements and unconventional policy plans, according to those who have beentold of the plans....He has to challenge Trump now,.. said Mac Stipanovich, an adviser to Mr.Bush during his 1994 campaign for governor who helped prepare him fordebates that year. ...He has to stand toe to toe with him and call him out...The difficulty for Mr. Bush, who has portrayed himself as the most matureand civil figure in the Republican presidential field, is how to inflict damage onMr. Trump in front of a live national audience without diminishing himself inthe process -  a tricky task given Mr. Trump's lust for the fierce counterpunchand Mr. Bush's disdain for memorizing sound bites....Jeb is a nice man. He likes people. He wants people to like him,.. saidNewt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who dominated several Republicandebates during the 2012 presidential campaign. ...He is up against a barroombrawler. And I think against barroom brawlers, if you are a nice man, you arebetter off keeping your distance...Interviews with current and former advisers to Mr. Bush and reviews ofvideo footage from his debates as a candidate for governor reveal him to be adebater with as many deficits as strengths. On stage, his mastery of policy isalmost unrivaled, but he struggles to synthesize it in compelling ways. He iscapable of telegraphing deep compassion in one moment, but can conveyunmistakable peevishness in the next. He defaults to analytical earnestness,rarely offering flashes of humor.For better or worse, advisers acknowledge, his brand is self-seriousness....His style,.. said Sally Bradshaw, a top Bush campaign adviser, ...issubstance......His candidacy,.. she added, ...is not based on theatrics...Theatrics have failed Mr. Bush at times. During a dramatic 1994 exchangein Tampa, he dared the sitting governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, to look intothe eyes of Mr. Bush's business partner, who sat a few feet away in theaudience, and repeat an attack on the two men's ethics....I know you don't respect me, but I know you respect Armando Codina,..Mr. Bush said. ...Can you look him in the eye and say that we've done anythingwrong?..Mr. Chiles, deploying his Southern drawl and a gift for outmaneuveringopponents, looked toward Mr. Codina, smiled and reflected on thebusinessman's wisdom in hiring the son of an American president....I think,.. Mr. Chiles declared, ...he made a good business decision when hetook you on as a partner...The audience broke into loud laughter. A few days later, Mr. Bush lost theelection.Mr. Bush has participated in about a dozen official debates since firstrunning for public office that year. The majority of those encounters have beenone on one with Democratic rivals, lacking the unpredictability of a crowdedstage, like Wednesday night's forum. After losing the 1994 election to Mr.Chiles, he prevailed in the 1998 governor's race against Buddy MacKay, Mr.Chiles's lieutenant governor, and in his 2002 re-election race against BillMcBride, a lawyer.In many ways, Mr. Bush's general election debates against Mr. MacKayare a model for how he might treat Mr. Trump in the long term. Mr. MacKayset aside his usual regal bearing and relentlessly attacked Mr. Bush as aninexperienced, untrustworthy child of privilege. Mr. Bush's strategy wassimple: deftly defend himself, sow doubts about his rival, but avoid excessiveconfrontation to magnify Mr. MacKay's smoldering temper.In a 1998 debate, when he was asked about his business dealing with aNigerian corporation, Mr. Bush pivoted to discuss a controversial investmentthat had earned Mr. MacKay $500,000. But instead of mocking it, hesuggested, generously, that there was nothing scandalous about the profit....I'm happy that the MacKay family made half a million bucks on a goodinvestment,.. Mr. Bush said, ...I don't see anything wrong with that. I applaudyou for doing that...Mr. MacKay looked slightly dazed.Seventeen years later, Mr. MacKay said he had miscalculated. ...I expectedhim to be more negative than he was,.. he said in an interview last week. ...I mayhave been too negative myself, as a matter of fact...In the same debate, Mr. Bush showed unexpected humility when askedabout his relationship with Florida's black voters, who had flocked to hisopponent four years earlier. ...Republicans have ignored the black vote in thisstate, and I was part of that, and it was a mistake,.. Mr. Bush said.His tendency to cram as much information as possible into an answer hasdiminished since 1994, when he became entangled in a long-windedexplanation of a real estate transaction. He described a maze of leases ...we hadto assume,.. a debt ...borrowed by an investor in the deal.. and ...specificobligations...But the habit resurfaces now and then....His mind rebels against the oversimplification that passes forsuccinctness in the television debate,.. said Mr. Stipanovich, the 1994 adviser....Instinctively he finds it incomplete and unsatisfying. So he over-answers...As Mr. BAs Mr. Bush prepares for brawl with Mr. Trump, that 1994debate against the wily Mr. Chiles looms larger than ever, a searing lessonabout the dangers of taking on an unpredictable opponent.Midway through that face-off, which seemed like an agonizing draw, Mr.Bush, the newcomer, suggested that Mr. Chiles, the incumbent, had lied to...strike fear in the hearts of the voters...Mr. Chiles stood silently, resting an elbow on the lectern and taking it allin. Then, peering over at Mr. Bush and jabbing his finger, Mr. Chiles deliveredan unscripted line about himself that changed the course of the campaign....I want to call attention to this old, liberal liar,.. Mr. Chiles said selfmockingly,pausing for effect. ...The old he-coon walks just before the light ofday...The camera captured a seemingly baffled Mr. Bush looking around theroom and then toward the moderator, NBC's Tim Russert.

2,0,"WASHINGTON -  When Carly Fiorina found herself relegated to the ...undercard.. forthe first Republican primary debate this month, she seized the opportunity to standout. Clad in a bright pink suit, the only woman in a sea of men, she delivered aforceful performance that catapulted her into the national spotlight and generated abounce in public polls.But Mrs. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, wants to be on the mainstage at the second Republican debate next month. And she is waging a public warwith both CNN, which is hosting the debate, and the Republican National Committee,which her campaign accused on Wednesday of ...rigging the game.. to keep her out ofthe prime-time event.CNN, which released its debate criteria in May, is planning to use an average ofpublic polls dating to mid-July to determine which 10 candidates will appear in themain debate.Because that calculation would include many surveys that were done before thefirst debate, in which Mrs. Fiorina delivered a strong performance, it would not fullycapture her gains in recent polls, some of which show her near the top of theRepublican field.Recognizing that Mrs. Fiorina may be excluded from the debate, costing hercrucial exposure and dampening fund-raising efforts, her campaign has sought toturn the likely snub into a public relations victory in an effort to win her sympathyand attract support from anti-establishment Republicans.The dispute with CNN and the Republican National Committee, which awardedthe debate to the network, allows Mrs. Fiorina to emphasize her outsider status, in acategory with Donald J. Trump and the retired surgeon Ben Carson, both of whom arewinning over voters in part because they are not career politicians.Asked about her battle over the debate criteria at a packed event in Cushing,Iowa, on Wednesday night, Mrs. Fiorina pointedly criticized the network and theparty....Let's forget that I'm a woman,.. Mrs. Fiorina, who is the only female Republicancandidate, said when asked about the debate. ...I'm in the top five in every state polland the top 10 in national polls. So what does that say about CNN and the R.N.C.?..She continued: ...I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing, coming out hereand talking to voters. As people get to know me, they support me. And you see that inthe polls, and you're going to continue to see that in the polls. I'll let CNN and theR.N.C. decide how they look if I'm not on that stage...Both CNN and the Republican National Committee have said that since the rulesfor the debate were released months ago, all the candidates knew the ground rules,and it would be improper -  and illegal -  to change them now.Mrs. Fiorina's campaign nevertheless called on the committee to push CNN tochange its criteria....All candidates are aware of the law that the media organizations set the debatecriteria, as the candidates asked,.. said Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the committee....CNN released its criteria over four months ago. All candidates were well aware ofwhat it would take to get into the two segments that CNN is hosting...Some Republican strategists said that Mrs. Fiorina could emerge a winner evenby losing a shot at the top-tier debate....Social media will light up in anger if she is consistently polling at 5 percent - consistently in the top 10 -  and ends up being denied because of a technicality,.. saidFrank Luntz, a Republican political consultant and pollster. ...Social media is runningthis election cycle, and it's a voice that's outside and powerful...On the other hand, Mrs. Fiorina might not have stood out so much in the firstdebate, in Cleveland, if she had been on the stage with the top-polling candidates atan event that was dominated by Mr. Trump. So there may be an advantage to her tocontinue to face the candidates trailing the field.The networks themselves are grappling with how to deal with the largeRepublican field. Their criteria need to be fair, but can inadvertently end up excludingcertain candidates, like Mrs. Fiorina, who could be good for ratings....I am sure Priebus would gladly trade Fiorina for Trump,.. said John Feehery, aRepublican strategist, referring to Reince Priebus, the Republican NationalCommittee chairman. ...CNN, of course, wants both because it maximizes the ratings...In retrospect, CNN's criteria for inclusion in its debate seem intended to make ithard for a second-tier candidate to move up to the first tier -  or for a top-tierindividual to be excluded.Unlike Fox News, which hosted the first debate and used the five most recentnational polls to determine who made the cut, CNN is using an average of nationalpolls released from July 16 to Sept. 10, conducted by 14 pollsters it identified asmeeting its standards.Of the polls that qualify, nine were conducted before the first debate and only twosince then, according to the Fiorina campaign. In both of those postdebate polls, Mrs.Fiorina was at 5 percent, up from 1 or 2 percent in polls conducted before the firstdebate.A New York Times analysis of polls that fit CNN's criteria found that if the debatewere held today, Mrs. Fiorina would not qualify for the main stage. Not only that, butif she were to maintain the same level of support she received in the two surveysconducted after the first debate, she would need 10 additional qualifying polls to beconducted before the next debate to eclipse Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who isthe last candidate to be included based on his support in an average of qualifyingpolls.The Fiorina campaign is arguing that CNN should give more weight to the pollsconducted after the first debate, and it has called on the party to pressure the networkto make the change.Some polling experts say that CNN's formula is misguided....I think they did not have a pollster at the table when they decided this,.. said J.Ann Selzer, who conducts one Iowa poll. ...I think it's hard to defend, purely from amath perspective...Many Republican strategists lamented the fact that Mrs. Fiorina might not makethe main debate, even as they said it would be wrong for CNN to change its selectioncriteria.Using ...more recent polls makes sense,.. said Newt Gingrich, the former Housespeaker and a 2012 Republican presidential candidate. But, he added, ...Rigging it tohelp or hurt one candidate does not...Katie Packer Gage, a partner at Burning Glass, a firm that advises Republicans ontailoring their messages to women, said that while Ms. Fiorina had gained a lot ofattention and had ...made a real impact.. on the debate in the Republican Party, sheshould not receive any special treatment....It is unfortunate, but I don't think the party or the network can change the rulesfor any one candidate,.. Ms. Packer Gage said. ...What about the Hispanic candidates?The African-American candidate? The Indian-American candidate? Should they allhave different rules? The rules were made ahead of time, and everyone knows them...Nate Cohn contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Corasaniti from Cushing,Iowa.",21.84,9.57,4.17,5.4,14.23,13.41,4.99,1.96,4.42,1.06,5.89,6.38,0.08,0,0.41,0,2.94,0,0
3,0,"DES MOINES ( As the first of more than a dozen presidential candidates to dropby the Iowa State Fair, Mike Huckabee mixed the serious with the jovial on Thursday,promising economic growth of 6 percent if elected president, but beginning a speechwith a culinary tip....Pork chop on a stick,'' he said. ...It's what's for lunch, dinner and a snack.''Mr. Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, also drew laughs with a jab atHillary Rodham Clinton. Along with a parade of Republicans who will visit the fairover the next 11 days, there will also be Democrats, he noted. ...Hillary probably is notgoing to come,'' he said. ...She'll email in her appearances.''In fact, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to come to the fair on Saturday. She will notspeak at the political Soapbox on the central artery, for security reasons and, mostlikely, the difficulty of managing what would be a huge crowd with potentially manyhecklers.Donald J. Trump, for different reasons, will also avoid the relatively cozySoapbox stage during his expected visit on Saturday. (He is also feuding with theeditorial board of The Des Moines Register, which sponsors the Soapbox.)Mr. Huckabee, the winner of the 2008 Iowa caucuses, who is running as aneconomic populist, said 6 percent growth or more -  notably upping the ante over JebBush's promise of 4 percent growth -  would be possible through what he calls theFair Tax, a type of national sales tax. Economists have expressed skepticism at Mr.Bush's promise of 4 percent growth, so Mr. Huckabee's 6 percent plan may cause evenmore raised eyebrows.Mr. Huckabee said his Fair Tax would encourage businesses to repatriate $11trillion that they had parked overseas and ignite a national manufacturing boom....Folks, it's not enough for us to have an idea and design and create something,.. hesaid. ...We have to make the things that we create...Besides delivering one more stump speech, candidates who visit the fair are ableto mingle casually with Iowans and show off a human side not always evident on thecampaign trail. People remember fondly Senator Barack Obama steering a bumpercar with one of his daughters in 2007. Less endearing that year was Fred Thompson, aRepublican candidate who strolled the fair in a pair of Gucci loafers (though Mr.Thompson claimed the story was apocryphal).Mr. Huckabee ( he wore ostrich cowboy boots, let it be known -  also visited theIowa Pork Tent, where he viewed a rack of sizzling pork chops just as they were liftedfrom a fire. One of the cooks asked if he'd like a bite....Of course I do,'' Mr. Huckabee said. ...You didn't think I came over here just tosay hi to you.''When his wife, Janet, sidled up, Mr. Huckabee asked, ...Woman, what do youwant?''...Shares,'' Mrs. Huckabee said.",18.42,8.98,5.43,3.55,13.78,13.15,4.38,3.34,5.22,0.84,7.52,7.31,0,0,0.21,0,2.51,1,1
4,0,"Updated, 9:59 p.m. | Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, whose early glow as aRepublican presidential contender was snuffed out with the rise of anti-establishmentrivals, announced Monday that he was quitting the race and urged some of his 15rivals to do the same so the party could unite against the leading candidate, Donald J.Trump.Mr. Walker..È pointed rebuke of Mr. Trump gave powerful voice to the privatefears of many Republicans that the party risked alienating large parts of the electorate... Hispanics, women, immigrants, veterans, and most recently, Muslims ... if Mr.Trump continued vilifying or mocking them as part of his overtures to angry anddisaffected voters.Still, Mr. Walker..È exit was not a selfless sacrifice: He was running low oncampaign cash, sliding sharply in opinion polls, losing potential donors to rivals andunnerving supporters with a stream of gaffes, like saying he would consider building awall along the Canadian border.Appearing ashen and drained at a brief news conference late Monday in Madison,Mr. Walker said the Republican presidential field was too focused on ...how bad thingsare.. rather than on ...how we can make them better for everyone... Without namingMr. Trump, Mr. Walker issued a plea to fellow candidates to coalesce around adifferent Republican who could offer a more ...optimistic.. vision and guide the party toa victory next year that, he admitted with sadness in his voice, he could not achievehimself....Today I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in thisrace so that a positive, conservative message can rise to the top of the field,.. Mr.Walker said. ...With this in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately....I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing thesame,.. he said, ...so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates whocan offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner...None of Mr. Walker..È rivals appeared poised to take him up on the suggestion ofbowing out, though they expressed surprise he was withdrawing so soon. ...Holy cow,..Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on Fox News.Mr. Trump, in a Twitter post, was magnanimous: ...I got to know @ScottWalkerwell ... he..È a very nice person and has a great future...Mr. Walker..È departure is likely to have little impact given the sprawling field. Hewas competing most aggressively in Iowa, which he deemed a must-win state, but hehad fallen from first place to 10th in a recent poll.And Mr. Walker..È message ... a tale of conservative triumph over labor unionsand other entrenched Democratic interests in a Midwestern swing state ... plainlyfailed to connect. He drew support from less than one-half of 1 percent of Republicanprimary voters in a recent CNN national poll.And while Mr. Walker had built a loyal but small network of major donors,including wealthy Republicans like Todd Ricketts ... whose father founded TDAmeritrade ... he was never a force in the Republican race for money, running farbehind rivals like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mr. Cruz.If the demise of Mr. Walker..È campaign emphasizes anything, it is the intensepressure that candidates are under to raise enormous sums of money not only fortheir political operations but also for their ...super PACs...Mr. Bush raised more than $100 million in the first half of 2015, providing himwith enormous resources to compete in a potentially long and costly nomination fight.Mr. Walker helped raise about $20 million for his super PAC and $6 million more fora related campaign committee, but Walker advisers were believed to be burningthrough cash. (His campaign finances will not be made public until mid-October.)The need to raise money has had the effect of turning the traditional state-bystatenomination fights into national contests, in which candidates need to provethemselves to donors across the country rather than merely win over voters in thehandful of states that hold the earliest caucuses and primaries. Mr. Walkerincreasingly tailored his message for Iowans, taking some sharply conservative standson issues like immigration and same-sex marriage that posed problems withmoderates....In a different era, Governor Walker could have won the nomination if all he hadto worry about was trying to win Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, andNevada,.. said Matt Moore, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. ...Butnow that the presidential race has become so nationalized, so early, a candidate canrun into big trouble if they peak too early and can..È show donors and voterseverywhere that they can recapture momentum...As recently as this weekend, Mr. Walker was telling supporters like Mr. Rickettsthat he was committed to the race and looking for ways to save money and jump-starthis campaign after a middling performance in Wednesday..È Republican debate. Butadvisers said that several factors had been weighing on him for weeks and contributedto his decision to quit.Mr. Walker was particularly anxious about accumulating a huge campaign debtthat he would struggle for years to pay off unless he won the Republican nomination.Compared with Mr. Trump, Carly Fiorina and Mr. Bush, Mr. Walker is a man ofmodest means: His father was a preacher and his mother was a part-time secretary,and he has earned government salaries for most of his adult life. He was not in astrong position to lend money to his own campaign, advisers said, nor inclined to doso.Yet campaign bills were piling up, with some vendors complaining that they hadnot been paid on time. Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, saidthat Mr. Walker was at a disadvantage in a large field of wealthy Republicans who hadpersonal, family or business connections to wealthy contributors....Scott Walker was a lot like the typical American in terms of personal finances ...he couldn..È write himself a big check,.. Mr. Kaufmann said. ...Nothing eats away at acandidate from average means like anxieties about massive campaign debts...Some advisers and donors also complained that Mr. Walker..È campaign manager,Rick Wiley, had built up a sizable organization in Madison but had devoted too littlemoney and staffing to crucial field operations. Mr. Wiley did not respond to requestsfor comment.Mr. Walker did start off as a particular favorite of prominent Republicans like thebillionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, who both believed that Mr.Walker was a tough, committed conservative who not only took on fights but also wonthem, as shown in his success cutting taxes and hobbling labor unions in Wisconsin.Yet if Mr. Walker..È record was inspiring, his abilities as a presidential candidatewere ultimately limited. He had verbal slip-ups almost from the start, like saying hecould defeat the Islamic State because he had won the battle against union leaders athome. And he came across as flat and lacking in sophistication in the televiseddebates....Scott, for whatever reason, didn..È connect on TV,.. said Stan Hubbard, aMinnesota-based television station owner and a major Walker donor. ...And if youcan..È make it on television today in national politics, you..Èe dead...Robert F. List, the former Nevada governor who was chairman of Mr. Walker..Ècampaign in the state, said Mr. Walker suffered especially because of the ascent ofcharismatic outsider candidates, pointing to Mr. Trump, Mrs. Fiorina and BenCarson....I attribute the difficulty here to the outsiders sucking up oxygen and diluting thesupport for the other candidates,.. Mr. List said. He added that other campaigns hadreached out to solicit his support. ...My phone,.. Mr. List said, ...is ringing...",24.87,8.35,5.1,3.25,15.08,11.37,5.96,3.09,5.96,2.01,6.96,5.72,0.31,0,0,0,2.86,0,0
5,0,"There will be no more flip jokes about her private email server. There will be no rope lines towall off crowds, which added to an impression of aloofness. And there will be new efforts tobring spontaneity to a candidacy that sometimes seems wooden and overly cautious.Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her campaign for president nearly five months ago, before thestartling rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, the volcanic candidacy of Donald J. Trump and thevery public exploration of another White House run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.In extensive interviews by telephone and at their Brooklyn headquarters last week, Mrs.Clinton..È strategists acknowledged missteps ... such as their slow response to questions abouther email practices ... and promised that this fall the public would see the sides of Mrs. Clintonthat are often obscured by the noise and distractions of modern campaigning.They want to show her humor. The self-effacing kind (...The hair is real, the color isn..È,.. she saidof her blond bob recently, taking note of Mr. Trump.) has played better than her sarcastic retorts,such as when she asked if wiping a computer server was done ...with a cloth...They want to show her heart, like the time she comforted former drug addicts in a schoolmeeting room in New Hampshire.And, to soothe Democrats uneasy about her shaky poll numbers, they want her to relentlesslycontrast herself with Republicans, saying she is at her best when showing willingness to dobattle....The true game changer is when there..È a personified opponent,.. said her communicationsdirector, Jennifer Palmieri.It is not clear whether any of these efforts can help Mrs. Clinton revamp her candidacy andregain momentum amid persistent questions about her use of a private email server at the StateDepartment and an electorate in the early nominating states that seems increasingly captivatedby the insurgent candidacy of Mr. Sanders.Previous attempts to introduce Mrs. Clinton..È softer side to voters have backfired amid criticismthat the efforts seemed overly poll tested. This time the strategy will compete with newscoverage on the latest developments over her email....The same force and energy that is giving a lift to Donald Trump is dooming Hillary Clinton, andthat is authenticity,.. said Eric Fehrnstrom, a Republican strategist and former aide to MittRomney. ...Experience does not matter to them. What matters is you appear genuine...Several of Mrs. Clinton..È top strategists, speaking from a corner office at the campaign..ÈBrooklyn headquarters with shabby mix-and-match chairs andexpansive views of Manhattan,repeatedly expressed confidence about Mrs. Clinton..È standing, saying that any candidate,Republican or Democrat, would love to trade places with her. Still, the landscape beyond doesnot seem so sunny, with recent polls showing an increasing number of voters do not trust Mrs.Clinton or believe she understands their problems.Even as the interview unfolded, one of Mrs. Clinton..È closest advisers, Cheryl D. Mills, preparedto be questioned by a congressional committee in Washington exploring the 2012 attacks inBenghazi, Libya.In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday, 45 percent of Americans said theyhad a favorable impression of Mrs. Clinton and 53 percent said they viewed her unfavorably.That is a weakening since July, when 52 percent had a positive view and 45 percent a negativeone.Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton..È campaign manager, sought to play down the polls..Èfindings, saying:...Even if you accept the ABC poll, our favorability is higher than any Republican...È.ÈOther changes are in store for the campaign after Labor Day. After a focus group in NewHampshire last month revealed that voters wanted to hear directly from Mrs. Clinton about heremail practices, she has sought to offer a more contrite tone, though her detractors say she isstill too grudging. (In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Mrs. Clinton said shedid not need to apologize for using a private email server. ...What I did was allowed,.. she said. ...Itwas allowed by the State Department. The State Department has confirmed that...)While Mrs. Clinton..È central message will remain focused on addressing income inequality andlifting the middle class, she is scrapping the phrase ...everyday Americans,.. which advisers saidwas confusing and did not resonate. (One compared it to the Walmart slogan, ...everyday lowprices...)Mrs. Clinton will still evoke the joy brought into her life by her granddaughter, Charlotte, but,given the child..È obvious advantages and privilege, will speak more broadly about building abetter future for all Americans..Èchildren and grandchildren.And former President Bill Clinton, who has had virtually no presence on the campaign trail, willbegin to travel the country to help with fund-raising this fall, with his first event planned forChicago on Sept. 17.Democrats have expressed concern that in some ways, the often reserved former first lady,senator and secretary of state does not seem aligned with the mood of the electorate this cycle,with voters flocking to anti-establishment firebrands like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. Hercampaign strategists, however, believe voters..Èfrustration stems from a sense that Washington is not working for them and not necessarily withthe establishment.Ms. Palmieri summed up the theme, repeating a line Mrs. Clinton had first offered last month:...She said ...I want to be the president who addresses the problems in the headlines and the onesthat keep you up at night...È.È.ÈNext month contains two big tests for Mrs. Clinton. The first Democratic debate is Oct. 13,putting her on stage alongside Mr. Sanders and other candidates eager to tangle with her. Andscrutiny of Mrs. Clinton..È private email use will intensify as she prepares to testify before theHouse Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22.While many of Mrs. Clinton..È aides still contend that the issues surrounding her email areoverhyped, they also now realize the campaign was too slow to take responsibility for whathappened and explain the intricacies clearly....Part of this is saying we understand Americans don..È always hear all the facts, and they want tosee their candidates saying they made a mistake and being contrite,..È.Èsaid Thomas R. Nides, aformer State Department aide and friend to Mrs. Clinton.The coming months will also be a period of trying to shed her scriptedness, which is not easy forthe policy-driven Mrs. Clinton, who in this campaign can easily be upstaged by the celebrity ofMr. Trump and the giant crowds attracted by Mr. Sanders.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will appear on ...The Ellen DeGeneres Show,..È.Èa prfogram on whichshe previously participated in a bowl-off against the host.

The Liberals are up as well, jumping two points. However, the Tories have slid to third, dropping five points and losing their front-runner status.Through the first half of this marathon election campaign, the Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats had been tightly bunched in public support. But this most recent poll, done for the Globe and Mail and CTV News, shows the NDP and Liberals cementing their support at the expense of the Conservatives.Though the Oct. 19 election day remains more than a month away, the new numbers will be jarring for the Conservatives. When Harper launched the campaign in early August ... making it one of the country..È longest and costliest elections in history ... he declared at the time that the economy and national security were the central issues facing Canadian voters.Since then, his party struggled to get its message out as unexpected momentum-draining events batter it.They started with damning revelations at the trial of former Conservative senator Mike Duffy that raised fresh questions about the involvement of Harper..È inner circle in the secret $90,000 payment to the senator.Then new data confirming the Canadian economy was in a recession for the first half of 2015 undercut the Tory messaging on the economy.Last week the migrant crisis in Europe was driven home by the worldwide circulation of photos of the tragic death of a young Syrian boy whose family had sought to come to Canada.That put the spotlight on whether the Conservative government was doing enough to assist with the crisis and put Immigration Minister Chris Alexander in the hot seat.Now it seems some of those headlines are starting to take their toll on Harper and his party as they endeavour to win a rare fourth mandate.In Ontario, the polling has the Liberals ahead with 38 per cent, the Conservatives second with 32 per cent and the New Democrats in third with 25 per cent.The survey results are based on a three-day rolling average of 1,200 voters, surveyed between Sept. 4 and 6.

Of that number, Canada has already resettled nearly 22,000 Iraqis.

The party then systematically challenged the eligibility of voters on that list, resulting in long poll lineups and delays.But today the same computer software that allows parties to build massive databases with detailed information about likely supporters also enables them to more precisely identify ... and target ... non-supporters.Parties use voter lists, digital maps, and information from public or commercial sources to build personal profiles ... each containing up to 250 pieces of data, from basic demographic information to culinary or musical tastes....These databases allow campaigns to send micro-targeted messages to specific audiences,.. the notes say.For instance, Spanish-speaking voters in Arizona received robocalls and mailouts in 2012 advising them to vote after election day.In Maryland, tens of thousands of Democratic voters were apparently targeted by robocalls in 2010 falsely saying their candidate had already won the election.The U.S. has also seen the rise of ...poll watchers.. recruited by activist groups, the notes say. ...They often harass voters in predominantly minority voting districts, create anxiety and agitate voters...Another tactic involves handing out flyers threatening jail time or other penalties for those who vote ...illegally.. ... a means of dissuading those who are unsure of their registration status or whether they have the correct identification.A multi-party parliamentary system like Canada..È may be especially affected by such micro-targeting, which tends to ...consolidate power in the larger, more well financed political parties.. at the expense of smaller ones, the Elections Canada notes say.In addition, micro-targeting can have a ...disproportionate impact.. on parliamentary systems, where subtle shifts in voter behaviour of specific slivers of the electorate in key electoral districts ...can indeed affect the distribution of seats in the legislature and even the composition of the government...",28.04,4.65,1.86,2.79,17.36,8.84,4.5,2.48,3.88,1.71,4.03,4.19,0.16,0.47,0,0,3.1,0,0

After the massacrein 2012 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School inNewtown, he promised to use all the powers of his office to push for legislativechanges that polls suggest were widely supported....Are we really prepared to say that we..Èe powerless in the face of suchcarnage, that the politics are too hard?.. Mr. Obama asked then.Less than a month later, Mr. Obama unveiled a proposal to overhaul thenation..È gun laws that would have included universal background checks and aspate of other measures he deemed ...concrete steps.. aimed at preventing moremass shootings....This is how we will be judged,.. he said in January 2013.The judgment came just a few months later, as lawmakers from bothparties forcefully rejected the centerpiece of the president..È gun controlagenda.

Instead, he pointed out thatthere is ...a gun for roughly every man, woman and child in America. So howcan you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make ussafer?..States and countries that have gun limits have far fewer gun deaths thanthose that do not, he said. ...So we know there are ways to prevent it,.. he said.He pointed out that the government responds to mine disasters byinsisting on safer mines, to weather disasters by improving community safety,and to highway deaths by fixing roads and insisting that drivers wear seatbelts.But guns are seen as so different that Congress has forbidden the federalgovernment even to collect certain statistics, he said. He rejected the notionthat the Constitution forbids even modest regulation of deadly weapons.He also asked news organizations to tally the number of Americans killedby terrorist attacks over the last 10 years and compare that with the numberkilled by domestic gun violence. And he implicitly compared the trillions ofdollars spent and multiple agencies devoted to preventing the relatively fewterrorism deaths with the minimal effort and money spent to prevent the fargreater number of gun deaths.And then he challenged voters to make gun safety a priority....If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your electedofficials to reflect your views,.. he said.Mr. Obama has long been seen as fairly unemotional, even distant.

But recognizing that he sounded more resigned then than heintended, Mr. Obama on Friday offered a more vigorous call for gun controlduring a speech in San Francisco....If Congress had passed some common-sense gun safety reforms afterNewtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their ownclassroom -  reforms that 90 percent of the American people supported -  wewouldn't have prevented every act of violence, or even most,.. Mr. Obama said....We don't know if it would have prevented what happened in Charleston.

But we might still have somemore Americans with us...Mr. Obama added: ...You don't see murder on this kind of scale with thiskind of frequency in any other advanced nation on earth. Every country hasviolent, hateful or mentally unstable people. What's different is not everycountry is awash with easily accessible guns. And so I refuse to act as if this isthe new normal...But the reality is closer to Mr. Obama's initial comments at the WhiteHouse on Thursday, when he said that today's ...politics in this town foreclose alot of those avenues right now...A variety of factors make this so. Since the 2012 shootings in Newtown,Congress has added more pro-gun lawmakers to its ranks. Although roughly adozen states have passed major gun control legislation in the interveningyears, even more have loosened gun restrictions. Mr. Obama, who convenedhis top aides in the Oval Office the night of the Newtown shootings to discusspushing for new gun laws, has put far more muscle into legislation where hecan find common ground with Republicans -  like his trade package currentlybefore Congress -  than face further frustration.The issue of gun violence has also been overshadowed by a focus on thenation's racial tensions after a series of killings of unarmed black men by thepolice -  and underscored by what appear to be the racist motivations of theman charged in the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church inCharleston on Wednesday night.Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a presidentialcandidate who has supported control legislation in the past, canceled acampaign stop planned for Sunday and issued a statement saying, ...TheCharleston church killings are a tragic reminder of the ugly stain of racism thatstill taints our nation...In Charleston on Thursday, a half-block from the church where theshootings occurred, Jack Logan unfurled a banner that read, ...Put Down theGuns, Young People... Jareem Brady, 42, stood talking animatedly next to Mr.Logan's banner, but said that racial discrimination was a bigger issue thanguns. ...That's what this is about,.. he said.The silence is frustrating to some lawmakers. ...Justified or not, there hastraditionally been a reluctance to talk about policy in the 24 hours after amassive tragedy,.. said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat ofConnecticut, who continues to advocate gun legislation. ...I really believe thatour silence is making us complicit in these murders...Americans have sent mixed messages on guns.A Pew survey last year showed that 52 percent of Americans said theythought it was important to protect gun ownership rights. That figure was upfrom 29 percent in 2000. In a 2013 poll, Pew found that nearly 75 percent ofrespondents supported expansion of background checks, which has been thefocus of much federal and state legislation.Still, more, not fewer, guns is the solution many state lawmakers and theNational Rifle Association are pushing to combat violent episodes. On afirearms Internet forum this week, an N.R.A. board member, Charles Cotton,indirectly blamed Emanuel A.M.E.'s pastor, Clementa C. Pinckney, for his ownviolent death, by criticizing Mr. Pinckney's votes as a South Carolina statesenator against proposals that would allow gun owners to conceal theirweapons when they carry them in public....Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expresslyallowed members to carry handguns in church are dead,.. Mr. Cotton wrote.Mr. Murphy recently introduced legislation to help states developlicensing programs similar to Connecticut's relatively new handgun purchasinglaw, which helps prevent those who would not pass a background check frombuying guns.Mr. Thompson, the California Democrat, said he was waiting to addressguns publicly: ...I think it is important to pay respect to the victims... He added,...I will never stop working on gun issues...But most lawmakers have turned to mental health legislation, includingSenator Murphy, who is working with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican ofLouisiana, on a bill to overhaul the nation's mental health programs. Both menhave also teamed up with Representative Tim Murphy, Republican ofPennsylvania, who just introduced a mental health bill of his own, an areawhere there will likely be broad, bipartisan support in Congress....There have been too many days since December 2012 that have broughtthat sinking feeling back to my stomach,.. Senator Murphy said. He added: ...Inever feel lonely on issues related to gun violence because 90 percent of theAmerican people agree with me and the vast majority of gun owners want thekind of reform that failed in the Senate two years ago. There is a reckoning. Ijust can't tell you how we get there...Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Charleston, S.C., and GardinerHarris from San Francisco.A version of this article appears in print on June 20, 2015, on page A14 of the New York editionwith the headline: Gun Control Voices in Congress Seem to Lose Their Resolve.Ω 2015 The New York Times Company",22.13,7.67,3.41,4.26,13.9,10.83,3.32,2.98,5.71,3.41,6.22,5.97,0.34,0,0,0,2.56,0,0
13,0,"Texas Lawmakers Pass a Bill AllowingGuns at CollegesBy MANNY FERNANDEZ and DAVE MONTGOMERY JUNE 2, 2015HOUSTON ... Students and faculty members at public and private universitiesin Texas could be allowed to carry concealed handguns into classrooms,dormitories and other buildings under a bill passed over the weekend by theRepublican-dominated Legislature. The measure is being hailed as a victory bygun rights advocates and criticized by many students and professors asirresponsible and unnecessary.The so-called campus-carry bill is expected to be signed into law by theRepublican governor, Greg Abbott. It would take effect in August 2016 atuniversities and August 2017 at community colleges.Supporters say it will make college campuses safer by not preventinglicensed gun owners from defending themselves and possibly saving livesshould a mass shooting occur, such as the one that unfolded at Virginia TechUniversity in 2007.Opponents say the notion that armed students would make a campus saferis an illusion that will have a chilling effect on campus life. Professors said theyworry about inviting a student into their offices to talk about a failing grade ifthey think that student is armed. And Democratic lawmakers and someuniversity leaders worry about increased security costs and the bill..È effect onrecruiting potential teachers and students from other states....The perception in academia will be that Texas is a free-fire zone withyokels in the classrooms packing heat,.. said Lynn W. Tatum, a professor atBaylor University in Waco and the former president of the Texas conference ofthe American Association of University Professors.Texas will be one of eight states to allow the carrying of concealedweapons on public college campuses, joining Colorado, Idaho, Kansas,Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin, according to the NationalConference of State Legislatures. Nineteen others ban concealed weapons oncampus, including California, Florida and New York, and 23 others, includingAlabama and Arizona, leave the decision to the colleges or state board ofregents.The bill that passed in Texas was something of a compromise that allowsprivate universities to opt out and public ones to designate parts of theircampuses as gun-free zones. But coming at a time when legislatures haveallowed guns at places from bars to houses of worship, it reflects the seeminglylimitless legislative clout of gun interests, particularly in Republicandominatedstates.One of the most prominent opponents of the campus-carry bill was anunlikely figure ... a former member of the Navy SEALs. Adm. William H.McRaven, the former commander of United States Special Operations forceswho directed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, is now the chancellor of the15-campus University of Texas System....I..È a guy that loves my guns,.. Admiral McRaven said. ...I have all sorts ofguns. I just don..È think bringing guns on campus is going to make us any safer.If you..Èe ever been shot at, which I have, then you have an appreciation forwhat a gun can do...In addition to the campus-carry bill, Republican lawmakers also approvedan open-carry bill, which gives those licensed to have a concealed weapon theoption of carrying it openly in a holster, although open carry will not beallowed on a college campus. The debate over both bills made gun rights adominant issue of the legislative session.One of the bill..È chief architects was Senator Brian Birdwell, a Republicanand a retired Army lieutenant colonel wounded in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack onthe Pentagon. Those backing it included local and national gun rights groups,including Students for Concealed Carry and the state affiliate of the NationalRifle Association; Tea Party activists; and Sheriff Parnell McNamara ofMcLennan County, which includes Waco. Other law enforcement officialstestified against the bill, including Adrian Garcia, who at the time was thesheriff of Harris County, which includes Houston.Supporters said that because Texans licensed to have concealed firearmsmust be 21 years or older, the number of the state..È 850,000 license holderswho will ultimately carry on campus will be small, and will most likely be oldercommunity college students more interested in protecting themselves as theywalk to their cars at night on campus than in carrying their weapons to afraternity party....An armed society is a safe society, so any time you have gun control, thereis far more opportunity to become victims,.. said State RepresentativeJonathan Stickland, a Republican and Tea Party favorite who often does hislegislative work at the Capitol wearing his concealed .40-caliber semiautomaticpistol. ...The criminals aren..È going to obey the laws. It..È the responsible folkswho we should be encouraging to protect themselves in the community theylive in...At the University of Texas at Austin, interviews with more than a dozenstudents Tuesday found little support for campus carry. The university was thescene of the nation..È first campus mass shooting on Aug. 1, 1966, when asniper, Charles Whitman, fired at people from the school..È clock tower in a dayof violence that left 16 people dead. The campus-carry law will take effect thereAug. 1, 2016, exactly 50 years later....I don..È think guns should be allowed, because that..È pretty scary,.. saidSarah Wang, 18, a computer science major and sophomore who stood near thetower. ...We..Èe already seen so many instances where people get hurt becausethere are guns in schools...In some ways, the legislative battle over the bill was symbolic. For years,Texans who were licensed by the state to carry a concealed firearm had neverbeen prohibited under the law from walking on or through the grounds of mostcollege campuses with their weapon. The bill gives those licensed to carry aconcealed firearm the right to have their firearms while they are insidebuildings and clarifies that they can be armed while on campus, althoughseveral caveats pushed by Democratic lawmakers will dampen the impact ofthe legislation.The bill gives private and independent colleges the option of opting outentirely. Public colleges have no such option, but lawmakers allowed universitypresidents at public institutions to come up with concealed-weaponsregulations that could let them establish gun-free zones on their campuses.The bill says university officials can establish ...reasonable rules,.. but statesthose regulations cannot ...generally prohibit.. license holders from carryingconcealed handguns on campus....While the passage of campus carry is disappointing, the legislation isbetter than it could have been in that we will be able to exercise some localcontrol,.. said Neal J. Smatresk, president of the University of North Texas, apublic institution in Denton. ...We need to review the legislation thoroughly toensure that we understand our latitude in controlling concealed carry oncampus...The Texas version of campus carry is more watered down than the lawspassed by other states. In Utah, the presidents of the public colleges have nodiscretion to write concealed-handgun rules. At Southern Utah University inCedar City, students and faculty can have concealed weapon just aboutanywhere on campus ... in classrooms, dormitory buildings and at sportingevents....It..È never been an issue,.. said Rick Brown, the university..È chief of police.The only episode he could recall was the day a few years ago when ateacher found a loaded clip in a classroom after class was dismissed andnotified the campus police. Mr. Brown said the clip apparently fell out of astudent..È backpack during class.Manny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Dave Montgomery from Austin,Tex.A version of this article appears in print on June 3, 2015, on page A11 of the New York edition withthe headline: Texas Lawmakers Pass a Bill Allowing Guns at Colleges",23.18,6.47,2.77,3.7,14.71,12.71,4.7,2.39,3.39,1.77,4.31,5.55,0.08,0.15,0,0,1.85,1,0

Antonio N.rdiz, a Spanish tourist from Bilbao, said hehad chosen a family vacation to America for one specific reason: to fulfill hissons..Èdreams of firing real machine guns. In Spain, he noted, 10-year-old Jonand 12-year-old Toni, like all other civilians, are forbidden to use automaticweapons.Mr. N.rdiz, 47, had heard that a family trip to an American gun rangeturned tragic last year when a 9-year-old girl lost control of an Uzi submachinegun, killing her instructor. So when Mr. N.rdiz selected that same range for hisfamily..È adventure ... a place called Last Stop, just an hour..È drive from LasVegas ... he called ahead to ask about security. Someone told him, ...It..Èpractically impossible for an accident to occur,.. he said.In the year since a New Jersey girl visited Last Stop and accidentally killedCharles Vacca, a 39-year-old father of four, little has changed in the nation..Ètourist-oriented machine gun ranges. Last Stop..È range, which receives 100 to200 visitors a week, is one of about a dozen places in the Las Vegas area thatoffer machine gun adventures....I promised that one day I would bring them to fire guns,.. Mr. N.rdiz saidjust after his children had used automatic weapons to pound bullets into a dirtpackedberm. ...So I looked on the Internet, and I found this place. Everyonespoke very highly of it. And the truth is that it..È fantastic...Mr. Vacca..È death on Aug. 25 prompted a brief but impassionedconversation: Should Arizona and other states continue to allow children tofire automatic weapons? A video of the girl and the gun in the moments beforeMr. Vacca..È death ... she wore pink shorts and a ponytail ... helped fuel thedebate.This summer, the owner of Last Stop placed the blame squarely on hisemployee, saying that while Mr. Vacca had been a beloved instructor, he haddied because he broke a company rule by standing next to the girl, not behindher. The power of the gun in the hands of a preteen, the owner said, was not toblame....We operate at the highest ... a higher level of safety than most of the gunranges I..Èe visited all over the world,.. said the owner, Sam Scarmardo, 63.Since Mr. Vacca..È death, he said, ...there really wasn..È an awful lot of safetyimprovement...Workers at several Las Vegas ranges said they still allowed children toshoot, noting that they had long worked with young people and were wellequipped to do so. The Range 702 in Las Vegas, for example, allows peopleages 10 and up to shoot and has benches that instructors can adjust to differentheights.Last Stop is a gas station and burger joint near the Nevada border. Mr.Scarmardo added the range in 2013, and it is associated with a company calledBullets and Burgers that picks up families and party groups at Las Vegas hotelsand brings them here to shoot guns and then enjoy a hamburger and a beer.The company promises visitors a ...Desert Storm atmosphere.. and theopportunity to shoot ...the actual firearms.. used in movies like ...Rambo: FirstBlood Part II...To many visitors, the experience is as quintessentially American as aroller-coaster ride at Disney World or a boat tour at Niagara Falls....This is the American dream, right?.. said Daniel Calvo, 31, a Spanishtourist who had just sent a burst of bullets flying as five friends in flip-flopsand shorts cheered him on. ...The guns, the trip to the Grand Canyon, the trip toLas Vegas...After Mr. Vacca..È death, a sheriff..È investigation ruled the killing anaccident, and an inspection of the range by the Arizona Division ofOccupational Safety and Health found only violations it deemed minor, likefailing to train an employee in the safe use of work-related chemicals.Mr. Scarmardo said he had decided after the accident to raise the agerequirement for shooting to 12, from 9, though employees are allowed to waivethat rule when they deem a child large and mature enough to handle apowerful weapon....If you..Èe got a kid who is five feet tall and as mature as a 25-year-old, hecan shoot,.. Mr. Scarmardo said.He added that children were typically restricted to using M16s or belt-fedguns that rest on a table or other surface, though a range employee later saidhe was unaware of that rule.Nearly all instructors have military experience and receive two weeks oftraining before they can assist clients. Tourists receive a safety briefing of fiveto 10 minutes before they pull a trigger.After Mr. Vacca..È death, legislators in at least two states, Arizona andLouisiana, tried to pass laws that would have set a minimum age for handlingan automatic weapon. Both efforts failed. State Representative Victoria Steele,a Democrat who proposed the Arizona bill, said her colleagues would notconsider supporting a bill that restricted gun use, fearing a backlash from theNational Rifle Association.Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have laws that restrictfirearm use by children in some way, according to the Law Center to PreventGun Violence.In the days after Mr. Vacca..È death, his children released a video in whichthey forgave the girl, who had come here with her parents and brother. In theirfirst statement since the video, the children ... Ashley, 20, Elizabeth, 16, Tylor,15, and Christopher, 12 ... said through lawyers that they wanted legislationthat would set age minimums for using automatic weapons....They say over and over again: We don..È want this to happen again,.. saidMarc Lamber, a lawyer for the Vacca family. ...What do we need to do to stopthis from happening again?..The family has decided not to sue the range or the girl, he said, choosingto focus on changing the law. ...Children shouldn..È be firing automaticweapons,.. Mr. Lamber added. ...It..È just a matter of common sense... Theparents of the girl, identified by police as the MacLachlans, declined tocomment.On a recent weekday, Mr. Calvo, one of the Spanish tourists, was surprisedto learn from a reporter that Last Stop was the scene of the killing he hadheard about last year. One of his friends, Samuel Pueyo, 29, said: ...Shooting isfine as an experience, but for adults ... not for children. It..È not ethical for achild...But Mr. N.rdiz said he felt very safe, and his children, Jon and Toni,agreed....Oh, my God,.. Jon said, rattling off the names of the guns he had fired:the MP5, the M4. ...At the beginning it was a little scary, but it was so muchfun...A version of this article appears in print on August 23, 2015, on page A14 of the New York editionwith the headline: Year After Death, Business as Usual at Gun Range.

He was 82.The cause was cancer, his wife, Lita, said. His death was not made public until this week.Adopted in 1969 to honor professional baseball..È centennial, the red-white-and-blue logo depicts a stylized batter facing an oncoming ball.

He did not expect to (his is an inherently anonymous calling), nor did he expect his work to endure: Logos are ephemeral things, with clients inclined to revamp them every few years.But this particular logo did endure. By 2008, as ESPN.com wrote that year, it had become ...a masterpiece of modern brand design.. that was ...more iconic and visible than ever...Yet Mr. Dior, who had never thought to retain a documentary record of the assignment, remained unacknowledged. It was not money he longed for, he said, but the simple act of recognition....Every now and then I tell someone the story about the logo, and their eyes go gaga, and I say to myself, ...Hmm, do they really believe me or not?..È.. he told ESPN.com. ...I want some sort of foothold or something, so I can prove that I really did this...Jerry Nicholas Dior was born in Brooklyn on May 14, 1932; his mother was a homemaker, his father a dressmaker. He graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island and studied on scholarship at the Art Students League of New York. During the Korean War, he served stateside in the Army.At Sandgren & Murtha, Mr. Dior was glad to land the M.L.B. assignment. A lifelong baseball fan, he adored the Dodgers until they traduced him by quitting Brooklyn in 1957, after which he threw his support to the Yankees.Per his instructions, he drew a generic baseball player. (In interviews years later, Mr. Dior stressed that the figure was not modeled on Harmon Killebrew as many people, including Killebrew himself, believed.) He executed the design in Magic Marker, originally making it blue and green before switching to a patriotic palette....It just came to me,.. Mr. Dior told The Wall Street Journal in 2008. ...I did the rough sketch and cleaned it up a bit, and that was that. I never thought anything about it until I turned on the television and saw it on the New York Mets..Èuniforms,.. where it was emblazoned for the 1969 World Series.Mr. Dior left Sandgren & Murtha shortly after designing the logo, and in later years he was a freelance graphic artist. But over time, especially as a string of professional sports logos, the National Basketball Association..È among them, were created as deliberate echoes of his design, the anonymity began to gnaw at him. He and his wife petitioned Major League Baseball for acknowledgment, to no avail.Then, in 2008, The Journal profiled Mr. Dior, quoting former colleagues who attested to his authorship of the design. Other news organizations took up the story, creating a groundswell of support.In 2009, after conducting its own inquiry, Major League Baseball officially recognized Mr. Dior as the logo..È creator, holding pregame ceremonies in his honor at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field....Jerry Dior created a symbol that has stood the test of time,.. Bud Selig, then the baseball commissioner, said in a statement that year. ...Forty years after its introduction, the ...silhouetted batter..Èis instantly recognized worldwide as the official emblem of Major League Baseball...Besides his wife, the former Lita Zweier, Mr. Dior..È survivors include four children, Mitchell, Rick, Jed and Donna Dior, and four grandchildren....I don..È think he ever thought he would be recognized and celebrated the way he was,.. Mrs. Dior said of her husband in an interview on Friday.

22,0,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. ... Louisville coach Rick Pitino has apparently said all he plans to say for now about the troubling allegations outlined in a book by an escort that has led to a sex scandal looming over his men's basketball program.Pitino was mum about the allegations on Saturday, but questions continue to swirl after the online release of Katrina Powell's book, ""Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen."" The 104-page book was published by an affiliate of the Indianapolis Business Journal and is scheduled for release Oct. 12, though the publisher said it could be sooner.Kate Snedeker, a spokeswoman for IBJ Book Publishing LLC, said that Powell is not doing interviews.While Pitino and Powell aren't talking about the book, Louisville confirmed Friday it has been investigating her allegations that Andre McGee brought escorts to dorm parties and paid the women to dance and strip, and have sex with recruits and players. McGee left Louisville in 2014 to join the staff at Missouri-Kansas City, which has placed him on paid administrative leave.McGee could not be reached for comment and messages left with his Louisville attorney, Scott Cox, have not been returned.Pitino was questioned about the allegations again after Saturday's Red-White scrimmage, but repeatedly said his focus is on coaching.""I'm just going to concentrate on basketball,"" Pitino said Saturday, adding that he has not read the book and has no plans to read it. ""When adversity hits, the strong survive. ... Idleness is what makes the mind wander, so the best thing I can do is work, work, work.""The coach also doesn't want players talking about it. He said his current roster had nothing to do with the allegations and has instructed them not to discuss the situation.""We told them it's not your concern,"" he said, ""and I've been told to coach basketball and not do anything else. Not get involved in this.""Cardinals forward Mangok Mathiang said it's out of the players' control.""All we're trying to focus on is the season coming up and the teams we're going to play,"" said the 6-foot-10 junior, who sat out the scrimmage with an eye injury. ""There's always going to be adversity and we've been through it plenty of times before.""As for the investigation, Mathiang added: ""Whatever comes out, comes out.""UMKC head coach Kareem Richardson is also trying to focus on basketball on his campus. The Louisville assistant from 2012-13 and McGee's current boss, did say the matter is a ""serious concern.""""We all need to allow the process to run its course without interference,"" he added in a statement Saturday. ""In the meantime, our coaches and student-athletes are focused on academics and basketball as the season gets under way.""Louisville has retained Chuck Smrt of the Compliance Group, which assists schools in NCAA cases, to review the allegations. It is unclear if university police have begun an investigation. The age of consent to have sexual intercourse in Kentucky is 16, though in some instances it could be 18.University officials say they learned of the allegations in late August and immediately notified the NCAA.Powell said in the book that during a four-year period many of the activities took place in the players' dormitory.The book said that Powell brought women to 22 parties from 2010 to 2014 at Billy Minardi Hall, which houses Cardinals basketball players. The woman said that she and three of her daughters, along with other women, danced and stripped for Louisville recruits and players and performed sex acts with them.The 43-year-old Powell also said McGee paid her $10,000 for the visits plus tips and offered recruits alcohol at those parties.In the book, Powell said that McGee initially brought women into the dorm through a side door. The process evolved to the point where the escorts entered and left the building through the front entrance and had become familiar to staff.McGee started 57 games at Louisville from 2005-09. He played professionally in Europe before becoming a program assistant in 2010, and he was promoted to director of basketball operations in 2012.The publishing company said it paid investigators and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Dick Cady to vet Powell's story, and based much of it on journal entries, photos and text messages.With the allegations engulfing he program, Louisville fans showed their support at Saturday's scrimmage for Pitino and his players, greeting them with cheers as they entered the court at the KFC Yum!

Goodell had suspended Brady in connection with accusations that he played a role in deflating footballs for competitive advantage in a January championship game.Like his predecessors in the N.F.L. and in other leagues, who for decades have had broad powers to protect the integrity of their sports, Goodell has made progress prosecuting players for using steroids, recreational drugs and other banned substances detectable with science.Continue reading the main storyRELATED COVERAGECommissioner Roger Goodell, above in 2014, was dealt a legal blow Thursday in the Tom Brady case.Sports of The Times: For His Arrogance in Tom Brady Ruling, Roger Goodell Pays the PriceSEPT. 3, 2015New England Patriots fans showed their support for Tom Brady during training camp in July.Patriots and N.F.L.

Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan listed a number of faults in the N.F.L.'s handling of Tom Brady's suspension. OPEN DOCUMENTPlayers armed with high-priced lawyers and publicists, and backed by a players' union led by a former prosecutor, have mined sometimes arcane labor law to argue they were denied due process and to resist Goodell's self-proclaimed goals to rein in misconduct....It really is exceptional how the federal courts have taken on the role of super-arbitrator of the N.F.L.'s disciplinary standards,.. said Michael LeRoy, a sports labor law specialist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. ...Commissioners have traditionally been godlike authorities dating back to Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The fact that you can go to court and get a judge to tell the commissioner what he can and can't do is extraordinary. It feels there are three parties at the bargaining table: the N.F.L., the union and the courts...The Brady case is emerging as the most vivid example of Goodell's efforts and their pitfalls.In vacating Brady's suspension, handed down in May after a league investigative report determined the quarterback was most likely aware that two team equipment staff members had deflated balls in an apparent bid to give him a better grip on them, Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan did not focus on whether Brady had tampered with the game balls. He did not question the outcome of the game, a 45-7 Patriots victory over the Indianapolis Colts as the team marched on to win the Super Bowl.Instead, he focused on the narrower question of whether the collective bargaining agreement between the N.F.L. and the players' union gave Goodell the authority to carry out the suspension, and whether Brady was treated fairly during his attempt to overturn the punishment.Judge Berman, in a 40-page decision that the N.F.L. has indicated it plans to appeal, found several ...significant legal deficiencies.. in the N.F.L. case. He ruled that Brady was not treated fairly and could not be suspended for deflating footballs because he was not aware such misconduct could lead to the kind of punishment he received....General awareness.. of others' misconduct, a reference to equipment handlers who may have actually deflated the balls, was not enough to suspend him, the judge said....The court finds that Brady had no notice that he could receive a four-game suspension for general awareness of ball deflation by others or participation in any scheme to deflate footballs, and noncooperation with the ensuing investigation,.. Berman wrote....No N.F.L. policy or precedent notifies players that they may be disciplined (much less suspended) for general awareness of misconduct by others,.. he added.Even if the league believed Brady had obstructed the investigation, by having a cellphone destroyed before it could be fully examined, as the N.F.L. asserted he had done, the judge sided with Brady's argument that ...there is no evidence of a record of past suspensions based purely on obstructing a league investigation...He found that the N.F.L. did not give Brady adequate notice of the potential penalty for the misconduct he was accused of and that he had been denied sufficient access to the N.F.L.'s investigative files and to a top league legal official reviewing the case.The way is cleared for Brady to play in the Patriots' opening game Sept. 10 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Foxborough, Mass. Already, the case had made for a protracted spectacle pored over and at times ridiculed on social media. There was the morning Brady, a player most likely bound for the Hall of Fame, walked into the sober confines of a federal courthouse in Manhattan -  with the ensuing jostle of the paparazzi and even a courtroom sketch that many felt maligned him and caused an Internet sensation. The judge himself at one point seemed to wonder if there were not more important matters in the world.Continue reading the main storyBreaking News AlertsSign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.Now, the N.F.L. may brace for a nationally televised hero's welcome for Brady accepting adulation from hometown fans not just for winning last season's Super Bowl, but for winning what at times has seemed like a personal showdown between the commissioner and one of his most marketable players.If Goodell thought he could win the day in court, he may have to rethink the strategy or take the chance that appellate judges might be more sympathetic on further review.In recent years, judges have found themselves enmeshed in cases involving players suspended for beating their children, punching their girlfriends and other criminal behavior far removed from the field of play. In the N.F.L., many of these cases fall under the personal conduct policy that legal experts say often falls short of clarity. This has allowed Goodell to penalize players, but also left him exposed to allegations that he has abused his powers.Lawyers are split on how the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit might rule. The league may argue that the labor agreement gives the commissioner wide latitude to take action against misconduct, even if his methods are imperfect, logic that judges have used to uphold the vast majority of arbitration rulings.But the appeals court may also agree with Berman, said Mark Conrad, who teaches sports law at Fordham University, because of all the procedural flaws he identified in the league's handling of the case.",23.64,6.04,3.17,2.87,14.2,9.89,4.23,2.11,3.85,1.06,7.25,4.61,0.23,0,0,0,1.06,1,0

But by live-streaming the game on its website, the league will be able to bypass cable and satellite companies that traditionally take a cut of the revenue from broadcasting games.The N.F.L., joining other content producers who are seeking to reach consumers directly, is looking for ways to reach consumers who do not have cable subscriptions....We..Èe testing alternative ways to distribute games,.. said Brian Rolapp, the executive vice president of media at the N.F.L.He said that the league..È current model of showing games on network television remains solid, but there are millions of homes without pay television packages and that could accelerate....If the world ever changes, we want to be prepared,.. he said.By streaming the game itself, the league can also reach fans in markets overseas where it is expensive to set up individual broadcast deals with local cable and satellite companies to carry games, according to Marc Ganis, a consultant to several N.F.L. teams. (An N.F.L. spokesman said the league was studying whether to hold the 2017 Pro Bowl in Brazil.)Streaming games could also give the league more leverage with CBS, NBC and other networks when they negotiate television rights deals because the league would have the capability of showing more games itself, Ganis said.The N.F.L. is still seeking an Internet distributor for the game, and that distributor is expected to keep the advertising revenue, Rolapp said. It is unclear whether the league will expand the number of games streamed and how soon, he added.Separately, the league said that it would not black out games in local markets when teams failed to sell out their stadiums next season. This so-called blackout policy began in 1973 as a way to encourage fans to buy tickets to games rather than watch them free on television. Under the policy, a home game could be shown in a team..È local market if the game was sold out 72 hours in advance of kickoff.As team ticket sales have improved, the number of games blacked out fell to zero last season and to two in 2013.

26,0,"The Blue Jays..Èmagic number has morphed into a Blue Jays magic moment.The Jays are finally and officially guaranteed a spot in the playoffs for the first time in 22 long, painful seasons. And not just by some convoluted twist of permutations and combinations but by their play on the field.Sure, it..È just the first step. Sure, the Jays are simply assured of a wild-card berth. There was champagne after the 10-8 win over the Rays on Saturday, that had waited, even though the numbers showed they had clinched even before David Price toed the rubber. But there is still work to be done. It was almost like a clubhouse celebration with training wheels, although for guys like Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion, R.A. Dickey and manager John Gibbons, all veterans dancing for the first time, the moment had to be special.The Jays will tell you the bar of their success will be set at nothing short of an AL East crown over the Yankees and, further, to first place overall, ahead of Kansas City, which would gain them home-field advantage throughout. Those are the magic numbers that will count as champagne-worthy.But getting a foot in the door is a necessary and important first step that guarantees meaningful baseball games in October, in Toronto, for the first time since Joe Carter..È dramatic walk-off blast against Mitch Williams in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series accompanied by Tom Cheek..È magical call of ...Touch ..Èm all, Joe... Perspective? Jays closer Roberto Osuna was not yet born.Simply by the numbers, the Jays played 22 seasons and 3,499 games, including Friday..È series opener against the Rays, without qualifying for the post-season. Sometimes I think it..È my fault. I began covering the Jays, writing columns on opening day of the 1995 schedule, a season that was delayed because of the late settlement of the 1994 strike by Sonia Sotomayor, now a Supreme Court justice, on the eve of what would have been an opening day for the Jays in Dunedin, Fla., with replacement players.That..È a playoff-less drought of 20 seasons for the primary major-league team that I have been covering. In a previous life as media relations guy with the Montreal Expos, I spent 22 seasons with a team that earned a berth in just one post-season, the strike-interrupted 1981 campaign, advancing to within one win of playing the Yankees in the World Series. Other than that, 41 years of nada.The following is a list of the only six seasons during that long playoff drought in which the Jays finished with a single-digit deficit in either the division or the wild-card race, six years in which they teased the fans and then backed away from the playoff table and failed again.2000: Third place in the AL East, 4.5 games behind the Yankees. In manager Jim Fregosi..È second and final season, lefty David Wells spearheaded the rotation with 20 wins. The Jays finished behind the Yankees and Red Sox, but came as close as they had to winning the AL East. The Jays won four in a row in the third week of September to close within 4.5 games, but faded to 2-8 down the stretch to drop to third.1998: Four games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. The Yankees swept away the East with 11 wins, but the Jays battled the Red Sox for the wild card in manager Tim Johnson..È only season. This was the first time the Jays went large in this stretch adding DH Jose Canseco, catcher Darrin Fletcher and closer Randy Myers to an already powerful lineup and deep rotation. The proximity to the Sox was somewhat a mirage because the Jays won win six of seven in the final week to pull back to within four games.2014: Five games behind the A..È for the wild card. The Jays had an opportunity to participate in the race last year with two wild cards up for grabs, but the Royals finished with 89 wins and the A..È with 88. The Jays were in year two of manager John Gibbons..Èsecond tour of duty, led by five pitchers with 11 or more wins and more solid work by Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion. The Jays were just 3.5 games behind the Royals on Sept. 17, then lost seven straight to make a strong finish after that meaningless.2006: Eight games behind the Tigers for the wild card. This was Gibbons..Èfirst tour with the Jays and his best record as manager until this year, winning 87 games. Lefty B.J. Ryan notched 38 saves and Vernon Wells hit .303 with 32 homers and 106 RBIs. Third baseman Troy Glaus slammed 38 homers with 104 RBIs. Once again, this wild-card race was not as close as it seems, as the Tigers, who had 82 wins by Aug. 27, faded down the stretch and finished with 95 wins and the wild card, then went to the World Series.2003: Nine games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. The best season for manager Carlos Tosca resulted in 86 wins, but a 15-game deficit to the Yankees and a nine-game gap to the wild-card Red Sox. Roy Halladay won 22 games and worked 266 innings, while Carlos Delgado and Wells combined for 75 homers and 262 RBIs. The Jays were 72-72 on Sept. 9 and charged hard down the stretch, going 14-4 to provide false home for the future. They were never close to the wild-card despite the numbers.2008: Nine games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. Gibbons was fired in June while just four games under .500, replaced by Cito Gaston. The Jays responded to the familiar guidance of their World Series manager, learning to once again go to the plate with a plan, an approach. Halladay and A.J. Burnett combined for 38 wins, while Ryan had 32 saves. The Jays won 10 in a row in September to pull within seven games of the Red Sox, but were 8-10 in the final three weeks to finish comfortably out of it.2015: Playoff bound. Finally the Jays are back in the playoffs, but with still more work to do to ensure the best possible seeding. Catcher Russell Martin has helped four different teams to the post-season in his first season with them ... the Dodgers (2006), the Yankees (2011), the Pirates (2013) and the Jays (2015).

27,0,"PANDEMONIUM: A state of uproar, shortened to roar for our purposes. Which is what Edwin Encarnacion detonated with three home runs. That was 1,136 feet of dinger all together.Pandemonium: The term for a flock of parrots. Which is what Double-E, on triple long balls, had figuratively perched on his right arm as he circled the bases Saturday afternoon -  a pantomime that has evolved from chicken wing, first time we saw the whimsical gesture, to exotic toucan.Last belt was a seventh-inning grand slam, ninth career, third this season. Nine runs driven in on the day for EE, tying a club record and extending his hitting streak to a major-league-leading 24 games.En-sanity.Then came the lids, dozens of them flung onto the field, because even a sell-out baseball crowd is never far from its point-of-reference hockey roots -  hat trick at the Rogers Centre.Encarnacion was puzzled when it started raining chapeaus, as were many of his 'mates in the dugout, until Dioner Navarro provided an explanation. ...He tell me, like, when they score three goals -  I think? -  they do that. It made me feel happy...The manager too was taken aback. ...I hadn't seen it before. Don't they normally throw octopuses or something?..Octopi, John Gibbons. And that's only at The Joe, where the other sports team from Detroit plays, not the outfit the Blue Jays routed on Saturday 15-1 as they continued their explosively awesome ways.Big innings. Humongous power. Scary torque.Really, it's getting ridiculous, especially as the Jays have been cutting a swath through August: 20-5 and the month's not done yet.It's been a top-to-bottom of the roster lollapalooza -  Toronto 1.5 games up on the Yankees -  with Encarnacion and Josh Donaldson leading the un-dog-days of summer charge. For EE, a six-pack of three-plus RBI efforts in his last 17 contests.One can get smothered in the stats. The more telling gauge, on this occasion, was that lit-up smile on Encarnacion's face. Sweetest smile on the team. Only chore was standing up in front of the cameras in the clubhouse afterwards. It is always a discomfiting demand for Encarnacion, who's still shy speaking in English. He prefers smaller gatherings at his cubicle, with only the writers posing questions....I know this is the bigger game,.. he said, when asked where this memorable outing ranked. ...I feel happy. And I thank God for giving me this game like this...At the plate in the seventh, bases loaded, Encarnacion said he wasn't envisioning grand salami. ...No, I never thinking about that. I was just thinking about taking good AB, looking for my pitch...Fastball down the middle from reliever Alex Wilson and Encarnacion feasted on it....It's very fun. But it's more fun that we're winning games. That's what we've been doing, winning games. Having fun, everybody, the team...How demoralizing it must be for opposing pitchers, having to contend with The Four Men of the Apocalypse at the top of Toronto's batting order colossi, and then everybody else because there's not a single weak link, as 18 hits, including four HRs Saturday proved yet again. Only Jose Bautista failed to get a hit, though he walked twice and accounted for two runs....I don't think it can get any better,.. marveled Gibbons, speaking specifically about his first basemen-DH. ...When I was here coaching first base, Carlos Delgado hit four in one game. Don't know how many RBIs he had....(Encarnacion) is some kind of locked in. When he gets going there's nobody better, nobody more dangerous...The Jays aren't just beating teams, they're annihilating them....To score as many runs as we've had -  big, big innings like we'd had -  it surprises the hell out of me to be honest with you,.. said the skipper. ...I can't say you start expecting it. What it does is, you're never really out of a game...Except they are expecting it. This is how the Jays roll -  ML-leading 709 runs, best run-differential in the majors.For Encarnacion, the only regret was that his young son hadn't been on hand to witness dad's record-book day. Eddie Jr. has gone back to the Dominican with school starting. Back on the island, no one has ever seen Encarnacion crank three homers in one day....That doesn't happen in the Dominican. The parks are too big...Encarnacion's pyrotechnics eclipsed what was also a momentous game for several teammates.Ben Revere extended his own hitting streak to eight games with a double on four hits and run scored. But his most impressive play was a spectacular catch at the wall in the first, when starter Drew Hutchison was still looking for his groove and giving up some alarming long fly ball outs. On that at-bat to Victor Martinez, Hutch visibly flinched as the ball carried and carried. Revere bounced off the 'pen fence to get it in his glove....Victor, I've been watching him my whole life, he's got a lot of power,.. said Revere. ...He kind of got me turned around a little bit. I thought I had another step to brace myself. Hit the chain fence pretty hard. Just trying to win good defence. Defence wins championships, so just doing my part...Took enough of a bruising boing off that fence, however, that Revere required an hour-long soak in the hot-tub post-game.You might recall that the Toronto surge began on July 29, with the arrival of Troy Tulowitzki, who homered that night -  now that was storybook epic -  against Philadelphia. Revere was leading off for the Phillies in that game. Made it just under the trade deadline for transformation shortly thereafter into a Blue Jay.Feels like he stepped into heaven, reeled in by GM Alex Anthopoulos, coming over here, being part of this....When I got that call from Alex, it was definitely: Open the gates. It was one of those deals where you drop down on your knees and pray, getting out of that situation (in Philadelphia)...Three hits -  all carbon copies, singles through the hole into centre -  for the always defensively stalwart Ryan Goins too. For good measure, his first career stolen base and a run scored by tagging up on a Donaldson sac fly -  from second, goodness -  when ex-Jay Anthony Gose apparently forgot how many outs there were, no throw....Just being relaxed, going out there with a clear mind, I think that helps a lot. Just getting comfortable and trying to be the best I can be for this team...Best team in baseball since the all-star break.The dictionary provides a third definition for pandemonium: ...The abode of all demons, hell...Hell to pay, playing Toronto: Demonic Jays.",13.38,11.87,6.07,5.8,14.25,14.51,4.13,5.8,4.49,1.41,7.3,6.42,0.53,0,0.18,0,2.9,1,0

To owner and breeder Ahmed Zayat, his Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness favourite is the horse of a lifetime....He is sheer brilliance and comes with unbelievable character,.. said Zayat, who was just warming up. ...He is a character. He is a horse that is kind, sweet, heady, classy, beautiful. It..È very rare to have a horse that has it all. He does everything as effortlessly as you can ever think...In the months after the bay colt was foaled at Stockplace Farm, outside Lexington, Ky., on Feb. 2, 2012, then moved to Vinery farm, Zayat received glowing reports, particularly about the way he acted around other horses....Usually, when they are young, they..Èe silly, they hit each other and jump on each other like little kids,.. Zayat said. ...I kept getting told he..È acting so mature and confident, like ...I..È the leader of this group...È..Right now, he..È leading many to believe he can win the Preakness on Saturday, set up a Triple Crown attempt in three weeks at the Belmont Stakes and end a record 37-year gap since Affirmed swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont....I am not going ahead of myself,.. Zayat said. ...We have to win the Preakness and have to see what happens before allowing myself to think of glory...Zayat, who has spent millions on horses since diving headfirst into the business 10 years ago, also is proud American Pharoah is a homebred, a son of his Derby runner-up Pioneerof the Nile and grandson of another Derby runner-up, Empire Maker.

Zayat would not sell for under $1 million. As it turned out, Zayat bought him back for $300,000.On to Ocala, Fla., where American Pharoah learned how to be a racehorse. The breaking process went well, and Zayat called in trainers for his ...breeze show.. to showcase his latest crop.Baffert immediately stated lobbying Zayat..È son Justin, the general manager of Zayat Stables....As soon as I saw this horse work on the farm, I sent him a video and Bob said to me, ...Justin, remember the Breeders..ÈCup is in California this year,.. Justin Zayat said. ...He wanted our horse. He saw how good he was from Day One. If you want to give a horse time to prepare for the Derby, you..Èe going to give him to Bob Baffert...All did not go well when American Pharoah arrived in Baffert..È barn at Santa Anita. The colt, who, according to Zayat, lost part of his tail when Preakness rival Mr. Z bit it when they were in the field, was a sensitive sort. Distracted occasionally. It showed in his first race. Under Martin Garcia, he ran second most of the race, went wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch and finished fifth going 5 and a half furlongs at Del Mar.Baffert went the cotton route for a fix ... cotton in the ears (earplugs if you will). It..È standard operating procedure before each race now.

He romped in the Rebel over a sloppy track at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, winning by 6 and one-quarter lengths. Then he clobbered the field by eight lengths in the Arkansas Derby three weeks before the Derby.Sent off as the Derby favourite, American Pharoah struggled most of the way in third place, then fought for the lead coming out of the far turn. He overtook stablemate Dortmund, then outduelled Firing Line and won by a length.

31,0,"If people need motivation to get up from their office chairs or couches and become less sedentary, two useful new studies could provide the impetus. One found that sitting less can slow the aging process within cells, and the other helpfully underscores that standing up -  even if you are standing still -  can be good for you as well.For most of us nowadays, sitting is our most common waking activity, with many of us sitting for eight hours or more every day. Even people who exercise for an hour or so tend to spend most of the remaining hours of the day in a chair.The health consequences of this sedentariness are well-documented. Past studies have found that the more hours that people spend sitting, the more likely they are to develop diabetes, heart disease and other conditions, and potentially to die prematurely -  even if they exercise regularly.But most of these studies were associational, meaning that they found a link between sitting and illness, but could not prove whether or how sitting actually causes ill health.So for the most groundbreaking of the new studies, which was published this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, scientists in Sweden decided to mount an actual experiment, in which they would alter the amount of time that people spent exercising and sitting, and track certain physiological results. In particular, with this experiment, the scientists were interested in whether changes in sedentary time would affect people's telomeres.If you are unfamiliar with the componentry of your genes, telomeres are the tiny caps on the ends of DNA strands. They shorten and fray as a cell ages, although the process is not strictly chronological. Obesity, illness and other conditions can accelerate the shortening, causing cells to age prematurely, while some evidence suggests that healthy lifestyles may preserve telomere length, delaying cell aging.For the new experiment, the Swedish scientists recruited a group of sedentary, overweight men and women, all aged 68, and drew blood, in order to measure the length of telomeres in the volunteers' white blood cells. Then half of the volunteers began an individualized, moderate exercise program, designed to improve their general health. They also were advised to sit less.The other volunteers were told to continue with their normal lives, although the scientists urged them to try to lose weight and be healthy, without offering any specific methods.After six months, the volunteers all returned for a second blood draw and to complete questionnaires about their daily activities. These showed that those in the exercise group were, not surprisingly, exercising more than they had been previously. But they were also, for the most part, sitting substantially less than before.And when the scientists compared telomeres, they found that the telomeres in the volunteers who were sitting the least had lengthened. Their cells seemed to be growing physiologically younger.Meanwhile, in the control group telomeres generally were shorter than they had been six months before.But perhaps most interesting, there was little correlation between exercise and telomere length. In fact, the volunteers in the exercise group who had worked out the most during the past six months tended now to have slightly less lengthening and even some shortening, compared to those who had exercised less but stood up more.Reducing sedentary time had lengthened telomeres, the scientists concluded, while exercising had played little role.Exactly what the volunteers did in lieu of sitting is impossible to say with precision, said Per Sj._gren, a professor of public health at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led the study, because the researchers did not track their volunteers' movement patterns with monitors. But ...it's most likely,.. he said, that ...sitting time was predominantly replaced with low-intensity activities,.. and in particular with time spent standing up.Which makes the second new study of sedentary behavior particularly relevant. Standing is not, after all, physically demanding for most people, and some scientists have questioned whether merely standing up -  without also moving about and walking -  is sufficiently healthy or if standing merely replaces one type of sedentariness with another.If so, standing could be expected to increase health problems and premature death, as sitting has been shown to do.To find out whether that situation held true, Peter Katzmarzyk, a professor of public health at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., and an expert on sedentary behavior, turned to a large database of self-reported information about physical activity among Canadian adults. He noted the amount of time that the men and women had reported standing on most days over the course of a decade or more and crosschecked that data with death records, to see whether people who stood more died younger.The results, published in May in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, are soothing if predictable. Dr. Katzmarzyk found no link between standing and premature death. Rather, as he writes in the study, ...mortality rates declined at higher levels of standing,.. suggesting that standing is not sedentary or hazardous, a conclusion with which our telomeres would likely concur.",24.2,7.79,3.31,4.49,14.64,12.87,7.91,3.19,7.67,0.47,4.37,7.79,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,0
32,0,"Worried about what to worry about? Accidents should move higher up your list.Worldwide, road injuries kill more people than AIDS. Falls kill nearly three times as many people as brain cancer. Drowning claims more lives than mothers dying in childbirth. Both fire and poisonings have many times more fatal victims than natural disasters. In 2013, the combined death toll from all unintentional injuries was 3.5 million people. Only heart disease and stroke were greater killers.These findings, published late last year in the British medical journal The Lancet, are from the ...Global Burden of Disease.. study, an international collaboration led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which tracks the annual toll of 240 causes of death for men and women in 20 age groups across 188 countries. The study isn't mere morbid fascination. Look beneath the top-level results and you also see huge variations among countries that are economic peers. This is actually encouraging news: It means that some countries have figured out a much better way to curb accidental deaths ... and that other countries might be able to follow suit.In France and Spain, according to the study..È authors, people die from transport injuries at roughly the same rate, but the French are twice as likely to die from falls, even when you adjust for the country..È older population. In Britain and the United States, deaths from falls are almost equivalent, but Americans are twice as likely to die from poisonings, again adjusted for age differences. Why?If Russia could emulate Brazil, it would cut age-standardized deaths per capita from fire by 80 percent. If India could copy China, it would cut age-standardized deaths per capita from drowning by 30 percent. How?The Global Burden of Disease study does not answer these questions directly, but it makes clear where to start looking for best practices. Individual countries can see in what areas they..Èe leading or lagging, often for the first time, then look to peers for advice or vice versa. Injury prevention may get one of the biggest boosts because global public health leaders have often ignored injuries as health risks, focusing instead on major diseases.Take drowning. For decades, it has been one of the 20 biggest killers worldwide, but the World Health Organization issued its first report dedicated to drowning only in November 2014.Effective prevention strategies include teaching swimming, providing life jackets, fencing off open water and training emergency medical responders. Drowning deaths also tend to decline as countries urbanize and when income and education increase. China, which both urbanized and started prevention programs, saw drowning deaths plunge from 190,000 in 1990 to 64,000 in 2013, Global Burden found. In India, drowning deaths barely budged, falling from an estimated 91,000 to 88,000 in the same period. David Meddings, an epidemiologist who was executive editor of the W.H.O. report, noted that China..È gains may partly reflect changes in the way deaths are reported, but that the improvement was still powerful....I don..È know why in India there has been economic development but drowning has not declined,.. Dr. Meddings said.Progress in reducing the 237,000 global deaths a year from fire is equally variable. It makes sense that more Russians than Brazilians die from fire: Russia has fearsome winters, and many fires are caused by heaters. But climate does not explain why the age-standardized death rate from fire was halved between 1990 and 2013 in Brazil, according to Global Burden figures, while in Russia, where more than 10,000 people die every year from fire, it did not decline at all....Outdated infrastructure.. ... wooden buildings with barred windows and sparking heaters ... ...is the major cause,.. said Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow and a contributor to the new report. ...Every winter, we have had cases where small hospitals or rural facilities for aged people were destroyed by fire. Dozens of people died in one moment...Show policy makers the larger data and what other countries are doing, Dr. Vlassov said, and there..È a better chance they will take appropriate action. ...For example,.. he said, ...in Russia, very strong legislation was introduced in relation to smoking almost two years ago. Smoking in public places almost disappeared...Poisonings kill fewer people than drowning or fire worldwide ... about 98,000 in 2013 ... but are still a major health threat, claiming roughly 2,200 lives annually in the United States alone, according to Global Burden data. The puzzle is why the age-standardized death rate from poisonings in the United States is so much higher than in Britain....Is it because we have more availability of things that other countries have locked down?.. said Jay Schauben, a clinical toxicologist, director of the Florida/USVI Poison Information Center in Jacksonville, and president of the American Association of Poison Control Centers. ...Is it we sell things here that other countries have banned? Is it a difference in the health care system, or because people are afraid of seeking health care because of the cost, and therefore they stay at home and die? Is it a difference in the population and behavioral use patterns?..Any one ... or all ... of these factors could explain the vastly different poisoning numbers, said Dr. Schauben, who is unaffiliated with the Global Burden of Disease study. So could disparate standards for reporting cause of death. ...How many of the unknown deaths do the medical examiners pursue down to the level of determining whether it..È a poisoning death?.. he said.Dr. Schauben notes that international associations of clinical toxicologists meet together annually to compare protocols and patient outcomes, but that a comprehensive tally of national and international poisoning fatalities is new and that many poisoning victims never reach a hospital or poison control center. ...This is the first time I..Èe seen the death rates,.. he said. ...Poison centers only know about cases that are reported to us...The Global Burden study exists, in part, to provide this kind of all-encompassing view of global, regional and national health, as well as to track progress or setbacks place by place, population by population. The project, which includes more than 1,000 scientists in 106 countries, began in the 1990s at the World Bank and World Health Organization and is now led by independent academic scientists with major funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.The new article in The Lancet is intended to be the first of a series of annual updates on death, disability and risk factors (like alcohol abuse, air pollution or lack of physical activity), providing the health equivalent of leading economic indicators. Where data on causes of death is sparse, the Global Burden team fills in the gaps as best it can with statistical modeling. The findings are therefore provisional ... the best available evidence, not the final word. Still, broad trends suggest that accident prevention continues to be neglected as a public health issue worldwide.The largest category of fatal accidents is transport injuries. In 1990, according to Global Burden figures, these were the 10th-leading global killer. By 2013, they were fifth, ahead of malaria, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis or any kind of cancer. In part, this is because of progress against disease. But it also because as incomes have risen worldwide, more people are buying ... and crashing ... motorbikes and cars.Research on transport injury prevention shows that collective action is as important as individual efforts. Motorcycle helmets, car seatbelts and sober drivers are important, but so are safe vehicles, consistent law enforcement and reliable infrastructure. At stake are the lives of more than 1.4 million people who die annually in transit.CONTINUE READING THE MAIN STORY56COMMENTSThe World Bank has made reducing transport deaths a major investment priority, and Michael Bloomberg is the leading philanthropist for global injury prevention efforts, as Bill Gates is for children..È vaccines.

33,0,"To the surprise of researchers who had thought the very notion a joke, an international consortium of investigators reported on Wednesday that shorter stature increases the risk of heart disease.After gathering genetic data from nearly 200,000 men and women worldwide, the investigators found that each extra 2.5 inches of height brings a 13.5 percent reduction in heart disease risk. The relationship is present throughout the range of adult heights.A person who is five feet tall has a 30 percent greater chance of developing heart disease than someone who is 5 feet 6, said a lead author of the new study, Sir Nilesh Samani, a professor of cardiology at the University of Leicester in England.Of course, the increased risk pales in comparison to that caused by smoking, which elevates the odds of getting heart disease by 200 to 300 percent.Continue reading the main storyRELATED COVERAGEHealth Guide: AtherosclerosisHealth Guide: Heart DiseaseDr. Sekar Kathiresan led one of the studies that focused on the mutation of the APOC3 gene.In Single Gene, a Path to Fight Heart AttacksJUNE 18, 2014Olive oil, wine and nuts are all part of the diet.Mediterranean Diet Can Cut Heart Disease, Study FindsFEB. 25, 2013There is nothing people can do about their height, but the researchers hope the finding will lead to the discovery of new links to heart disease. The paper was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.No one was more surprised by the result than heart disease experts, although they have known about a purported association between height and heart disease for more than half a century. It was first pointed out in 1951 by Dr. Paul Dudley White, a cardiologist who was President Dwight D. Eisenhower's physician.He observed that 97 men and three women who had a heart attack before age 40 and were admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital were two inches shorter on average than 146 healthy men.Since then, experts have noted that shorter people are more likely to get heart disease in a variety of populations and ethnic groups, even after accounting for such risk factors as smoking and cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. But few researchers took the finding seriously.Height was just a marker for some other problem causing heart disease, most scientists said -  perhaps a poor diet, or infectious diseases in childhood that led to a lifelong weakness of the heart....This idea that shorter stature is associated with coronary artery disease is something we would laugh about,.. said Dr. Michael Lauer, director of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ...We would think about it as yet another example of epidemiology going amok...Dr. Samani and his colleagues realized that if there was a real link, genetic variations that resulted in short stature would also result in a greater risk of heart disease.Previous research had identified 180 genetic variants that control height. To find out if those variants also affected heart disease risk, Dr. Samani and his colleagues examined the genetic profiles of more than 200,000 people whose DNA had been analyzed in a variety of other studies.People with the genetic variants were more prone to heart disease, the scientists found. But what was the connection? Did the genes controlling height also affect obesity, diabetes or blood pressure?Dr. Samani and his colleagues found just one link, and it was a very small one: The genetic variants associated with shorter stature also were linked to slightly higher levels of LDL, the form of cholesterol that increases heart disease risk, and to slightly higher levels of triglycerides, blood fats that are also a risk.But that was not enough to account for all of the increased risk, noted Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, an author of the paper and director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital. The rest, the researchers speculated, may come from poorly understood mechanisms, governed by height genes, that control the development of both blood vessels and bones.Not everyone is impressed by the new report. Dr. Kari Stefansson, chief executive of deCODE Genetics, said the increase in heart disease risk was real but so small as to be not very meaningful. ...It's a weak effect,.. he said.Others, like Dr. Lauer, find the new report an exciting taste of the science to come. Until recently, heart disease research focused on factors that greatly increase risk, like cholesterol levels. Research into the genetic underpinnings of disease may point to more ...low-hanging fruit.. in ...other orchards we haven't seen,.. Dr. Lauer said.Studies of huge DNA databases, like the new research, show the power of genetics to resolve questions that had seemed unanswerable....The Achilles' heel of epidemiology has been the inability to distinguish between associations that are correlations and those that are causal,.. Dr. Lauer said. Until now, the only way to do that was through large, expensive and time-consuming randomized controlled clinical trials.For example, the Women's Health Initiative studied whether taking hormones after menopause could reduce the risk of heart disease, which seemed well established. Thousands of women were told to take hormones after menopause, or not to. After years of study and millions of dollars, the result was clear: The hormones did not protect against heart disease.Of course, no randomized trial can test whether height is linked to heart disease risk. But genetic variations are distributed at random in populations, and genes are not affected by lifestyle or environmental factors that have to be accounted for when researchers analyze data they get by simply observing populations.In a sense, Dr. Lauer said, we are nature's random experiments.",23.05,6.03,1.27,4.76,14.71,10.48,5.08,2.96,6.46,2.54,5.61,6.35,0.42,0,0.21,0,1.27,0,0
34,0,"As complaints grow about exorbitant drug prices, pharmaceutical companies are coming under pressure to disclose the development costs and profits of those medicines and the rationale for charging what they do.So-called pharmaceutical cost transparency bills have been introduced in at least six state legislatures in the last year, aiming to make drug companies justify their prices, which are often attributed to high research and development costs....If a prescription drug demands an outrageous price tag, the public, insurers and federal, state and local governments should have access to the information that supposedly justifies the cost,.. says the preamble of a bill introduced in the New York State Senate in May.U.S. Shifts Stance on Drug Pricing in Pacific Trade Pact Talks, Document RevealsJUNE 10, 2015The New Health Care: With Sickest Patients, Cost Sharing Comes at a PriceMAY 4, 2015In an article being published Thursday, more than 100 prominent oncologists called for support of a grass-roots movement to stem the rapid increases of prices of cancer drugs, including by letting Medicare negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies and letting patients import less expensive medicines from Canada....There is no relief in sight because drug companies keep challenging the market with even higher prices,.. the doctors wrote in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. ...This raises the question of whether current pricing of cancer drugs is based on reasonable expectation of return on investment or whether it is based on what prices the market can bear...Pressure is mounting from elsewhere as well. The top Republican and Democrat on the United States Senate Finance Committee last year demanded detailed cost data from Gilead Sciences, whose hepatitis C drugs, which cost $1,000 a pill or more, have strained the budgets of state and federal health programs. The U.A.W. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust tried to make Gilead, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Celgene and other companies report to their shareholders more about how they set prices and the risks to their businesses from resistance to high drug prices.The trust cited the more than $300,000 per year price of Vertex..È cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and roughly $150,000 for Celgene..È cancer drug Revlimid.Even former President Bill Clinton, in a speech to pharmaceutical executives in Philadelphia last month, said it would be in the industry..È best interest to say more about its costs and pricing....Explain, explain, explain and disclose, disclose, disclose,.. Mr. Clinton said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. ...Don..È expect everybody to love you, but at least they will hear your side of the story...The pharmaceutical industry has already had the veil lifted on various practices. Drug companies now have to report the payments, including meals and entertainment, that they make to doctors for research, consulting and giving promotional speeches. The companies have also had to disclose more results of their clinical trials and in some cases have started to provide raw data to outsiders.It is unclear if cost and pricing will become the next such area. The state bills, which are supported by some health insurers and consumer groups, have not progressed. The two senators, Republican Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, have not reported the results of their inquiry. And shareholders of Gilead, Vertex and Celgene voted down the resolutions proposed by the U.A.W. trust, though the trust says it reached settlements with Eli Lilly and with two other drug companies it would not identify.The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry trade groups say the transparency bills would be costly to comply with and would provide misleading information.Even some people concerned about drug prices say that the cost to develop a particular drug has little to do with that drug..È price and that knowing such information will not keep prices down....The past R&D cost is really kind of a red herring,.. said Len Nichols, a health care economist at George Mason University, referring to research and development. ...The current revenue doesn..È pay for past R&D; it pays for current R&D...Prices for cancer drugs, some of which extend lives by only a couple of months, routinely exceed $100,000 a year, and some new ones exceed $150,000. And it is not unusual for the list prices of existing drugs to rise 10 percent or more year after year, far beyond the rate of inflation. The prices of older drugs for multiple sclerosis have risen from about $10,000 per year in the late 1990s to more than $60,000 now, according to a study, even as competition in the market has intensified with the introduction of new products.Cost transparency bills have also been introduced in California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania.Three of the bills require disclosures for drugs costing $10,000 or more per year. The others have different criteria. Besides development costs, some of the bills would require disclosure of the costs of manufacturing, marketing and advertising. At least some of the bills also ask for a history of price increases, the profit attributable to the drug and how much a company spends in providing financial assistance to patients using the drug.Two of the bills would allow the states to act on the information, not just require disclosure. Pennsylvania..È would allow insurers to refuse to pay for a drug if the manufacturer did not file the required report. In Massachusetts, a state commission would be able to set a maximum price for a drug if it determined that the price set by the manufacturer was significantly high compared with the benefits, costs or prices in other countries.Most of the bills have not been acted upon, though hearings were held in California and Oregon.The sponsor of the California bill, Assemblyman David Chiu, pulled it back shortly before a committee was to vote on it, apparently because it did not have sufficient support. The bill could be picked up again next year....This is a new topic for many of my colleagues to grapple with,.. said Mr. Chiu, a Democrat from San Francisco. He said the bill was necessary because ...greater transparency leads to better policy results...Mitch Greenlick, a Democrat from Portland who is chairman of the Health Care Committee in Oregon..È House of Representatives, said the bill was prepared with input from the health insurance industry, but was ...not ready for prime time... He added that the issue would be further studied....What are we going to do with that information?.. he said. ...It..È interesting to have, I suppose, but the drug companies are shameless, and they charge what they can get away with...Insurers and consumer groups told the Oregon Legislature that more disclosure was needed because the state had to decide whether to pay for certain drugs. Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry said the bill was unfair and would discourage industry investment in Oregon.Lori Reilly, executive vice president for policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry..È main trade group, said it was misleading to look only at the cost of developing a particular drug because that ignored the money spent on the drugs that fail during development. Only about 12 percent of drugs tested in people reach the market, she said.Ms. Reilly said that publicly traded drug companies already disclosed their overall research and development costs, as well as other financial information. She also said that focusing on costs ignored the value of the drugs. Some drugs, for instance, can save money for the health system over all by keeping people out of the hospital, she said.Pharmaceutical executives do not typically tie the price of any particular drug to its development cost. But they do say that their sales have to recoup their investment in research and development if the companies are to stay in business.They often cite the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, which last year said companies spent an average of $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market, up from an estimate of $800 million in 2003. That includes the cost of failures. And almost half the figure is opportunity cost, the amount a company might have earned if it had invested money elsewhere rather than spending it on drug development.Critics are skeptical of that figure, saying that the Tufts center gets funding from the pharmaceutical industry and uses data supplied by the drug companies, but does not disclose which drugs are used as the basis of the estimates.Pharmaceutical executives often say they price the drugs based on the value they provide, though often a detailed explanation of that is not provided. In many cases, it appears, the price of new drugs is set in comparison to rival drugs already on the market, and usually a bit higher. Companies then can raise their prices for the older drugs....We all look at each other and keep pace with each other,.. said a director of one multiple sclerosis drug developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ...Honestly, there is no science to it...CONTINUE READING THE MAIN STORY401COMMENTSJohn Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a group of insurers, consumer organizations, labor unions and employers concerned about drug prices, said his group hoped to introduce transparency legislation in Congress, but aimed at determining how drug companies estimate the value of their drugs, not the research and development costs....The industry has used R&D costs for the justification, but anyone who is reasonably sophisticated understands those are sunk costs and have little to do with pricing,.. Mr. Rother said. ...The more important information is any calculation of value.

35,0,"After decades of worsening diets and sharp increases in obesity, Americans..Èeating habits have begun changing for the better.Calories consumed daily by the typical American adult, which peakedaround 2003, are in the midst of their first sustained decline since federalstatistics began to track the subject, more than 40 years ago. The number ofcalories that the average American child takes in daily has fallen even more ...by at least 9 percent.The declines cut across most major demographic groups ... includinghigher- and lower-income families, and blacks and whites ... though they varysomewhat by group.In the most striking shift, the amount of full-calorie soda drunk by theaverage American has dropped 25 percent since the late 1990s.As calorie consumption has declined, obesity rates appear to have stoppedrising for adults and school-aged children and have come down for theyoungest children, suggesting the calorie reductions are making a difference.The reversal appears to stem from people..È growing realization that theywere harming their health by eating and drinking too much. The awarenessbegan to build in the late 1990s, thanks to a burst of scientific research aboutthe costs of obesity, and to public health campaigns in recent years.The encouraging data does not mean an end to the obesity epidemic:More than a third of American adults are still considered obese, putting themat increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Americans are stilleating far too few fruits and vegetables and far too much junk food, even ifthey are eating somewhat less of it, experts say.But the changes in eating habits suggest that what once seemed aninexorable decline in health may finally be changing course. Since the mid-1970s, when American eating habits began to rapidly change, calorieconsumption had been on a near-steady incline....I think people are hearing the message, and diet is slowly improving,..said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, the dean of the Friedman School of NutritionScience and Policy at Tufts University.Barry Popkin, a University of North Carolina professor who has studiedfood data extensively, described the development as a ...turning point.There is no perfect way to measure American calorie consumption. Butthree large sources of data about diet all point in the same direction. Detaileddaily food diaries tracked by government researchers, data from food barcodes and estimates of food production all show reductions in the caloriesconsumed by the average American since the early 2000s. Those signals, alongwith the flattening of the national obesity rate, have convinced many publichealth researchers that the changes are meaningful.The eating changes have been the most substantial in households withchildren. Becky Lopes-Filho..È 4-year-old son, Sebastian, has always been atthe top of the growth chart for weight. Ms. Lopes-Filho, 35, is the operationsmanager of a pizzeria in Cambridge, Mass., and her son, like her, loves food.As he has gotten older, she has grown more concerned about his cravings forsweets. Instead of a cookie every day now, she said, she has been trying to limithim to one a week. ...If he was given access, he would just go nuts,.. she said....He, I think, would tend to be a super obese kid...There is no single moment when American attitudes toward eatingchanged, but researchers point to a 1999 study as a breakthrough. That year,researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published apaper in The Journal of the American Medical Association that turned intosomething of a blockbuster.The paper included bright blue maps illustrating worsening obesity ratesin the 1980s and 1990s in all 50 states. Researchers knew the obesity rate wasrising, but Dr. Ali Mokdad, the paper..È lead author, said that when hepresented the maps at conferences, even the experts were gasping. A yearlater, he published another paper, with a similar set of maps, showing a relatedexplosion in diabetes diagnoses. ...People became more aware of it in a veryvisual and impactful way,.. said Hank Cardello, a former food industryexecutive who is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservativepolicy center. ...That created a lot of attention and concern...Shortly afterward, the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, issued a report... ...Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity.. ...modeled on the famous 1964 surgeon general..È report on tobacco. The 2001report summarized the increasing evidence that obesity was a risk factor forseveral chronic diseases, and said controlling children..È weight should be apriority, to prevent the onset of obesity-related illnesses.Slowly, the messages appear to have sunk in with the public. By 2003, 60percent of Americans said they wanted to lose weight, according to Gallup, upfrom 52 percent in 1990 and 35 percent in the 1950s.The Obama administration has increased pressure. The Affordable CareAct, passed in 2010, required chain restaurants to publish the calorie contentof their meals. The federal government has also changed requirements,making school lunches healthier, although the effort has created somebacklash.Several cities have gone further. Philadelphia subsidizes producepurchases for the poor. New York limits the kind of food available in day carecenters. Berkeley, Calif., last year became the first city in the United States totax sugar-sweetened beverages. The evidence for the effectiveness of theseinterventions is mixed, but their popularity reflects public health officials..Èemphasis on diet and obesity.Still, the timeline of the calorie declines suggests that people startedeating a little less before policy makers got involved. That follows the patternfor tobacco use, which peaked right around the time of the 1964 surgeongeneral..È report. The policy changes that many credit with the country..È sharpreductions in smoking ... advertising bans, warning labels, taxes andrestrictions on smoking in public ... came later, accelerating change afterattitudes had already begun to shift.The anti-obesity public health campaigns have focused on one subjectmore than any other: beverages.Anti-soda messages hit their target. Americans, on average, purchasedabout 40 gallons of full-calorie soda a year in 1998, according to sales datafrom the industry trade publication Beverage Digest analyzed by the Center forScience in the Public Interest. That fell to 30 gallons in 2014, about the levelthat Americans bought in 1980, before the obesity rates took off....I think the attitude more and more in this country is that it..È not a goodidea to consume a lot of soda,.. said Dr. Satcher, now a professor at theMorehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.Beverage companies have reacted by marketing diet drinks and investingheavily in new products, including iced teas and flavored water. ...A lot of thechanges we are seeing are consumer-driven,.. said John Sicher, BeverageDigest..È publisher.Outside of beverages, there are few clear trends. Experts who haveexamined the data say the reductions do not mean that Americans are flockingto farmer..È markets and abandoning fast food. Consumption of fruits andvegetables remains low; consumption of desserts remains high. Instead,people appear to be eating a little less of everything. Although consumption innearly every category has been ...cut some,.. said Mr. Popkin, ...the food part ofour diet is horrendous and remains horrendous...The calorie reductions are seen across nearly every demographic group,but not equally. White families have reduced their calorie consumption morethan black and Hispanic families. Most starkly, families with children have cutback more than households with adults living alone, further evidence, expertssay, that the public health emphasis on childhood obesity is driving thechanges.Ms. Lopes-Filho said she..È seen how her concern about her son..È diet hassubtly changed her own eating habits. ...I think I..È still sneaking stuff behindhis back, but I have tried to change,.. she said. ...I haven..È been drinking soda ordoing a lot of sugary drinks in a while, but all because of him ... because I knowthat if I have it, he..È going to want it. And there..È really no fair way to say, ...No,this is Mommy..È drink...È..Perhaps the biggest caveat to the trend is that it does not appear to extendto the very heaviest Americans. Among the most overweight people, weightand waist circumference have all continued rising in recent years.The recent calorie reductions appear to be good news, but they, alone, willnot be enough to reverse the obesity epidemic. A paper by Kevin Hall, aresearcher at the National Institutes of Health, estimated that for Americansto return to the body weights of 1978 by 2020, an average adult would need toreduce calorie consumption by 220 calories a day. The recent reductionsrepresent just a fraction of that change....This was like a freight train going downhill without brakes,.. KellyBrownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, said....Anything slowing it down is good...More information about the data sources we examined, and theirvarious strengths and weaknesses, can be found here.Emily Hopkins contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy andeveryday life.

At a training camp the winter after returning from Atlanta, a national team doctor talked to Hughes about depression and suggested ways to get help....I walked out the meeting thinking, you..Èe not going to tell me what..È wrong with me, there..È nothing wrong with me.

And, a higher danger lurks on the Internet, indoors...Among the grades in the report card was a D minus for overall physical activity, in part because just nine per cent of 5- to 17-year-olds meet daily recommendations of at least one hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. (The grade remains unchanged for three years in a row.) By comparison, 70 per cent of 3- and 4-year-olds get the recommended 180 minutes a day of activity.The report card, titled The Biggest Risk is Keeping Kids Indoors, is based on data from various sources, including peer-reviewed research. For the first time in 11 years, the report includes a position statement developed by HALO-CHEO and 12 other organizations, which promotes active outdoor play. It also contains recommendations aimed at, for instance, parents, educators, health professionals, municipalities, even attorneys general.Toronto mom Jaimie Cowles, whose children spend as much time playing outdoors as possible, needs no convincing of its benefits. While at the park, she doesn't really supervise her kids, Hanna, 7, and Ben, 5. Instead, she lets them explore and play on their own, which builds social skills and self-assurance....It's allowed them to take small risks that will give them the tools they need to take bigger risks later,.. says Cowles. ...They can assess what's going to be ...dangerous' -  obviously, we're not exposing them to actual danger but what they perceive to be dangerous...Tremblay says parents who over-supervise their children are minimizing their child's resiliency, decision-making capabilities and executive functioning....These are, of course, the features that we want our kids to develop. And in order for them to develop, you've got to allow them to take some risks. ..Sure, your kid may come home with a scraped knee, he says, adding serious injuries happen periodically and catastrophic injuries occur very rarely. But that's no justification for over-supervising kids or prohibiting active outdoor play because the long-term consequences of sedentary behaviour are a variety of mental and physical health issues, including the development of heart disease, obesity and Type 2 Diabetes....Sanitizing and bubble wrapping the entire population to prevent what, in many cases is the unpreventable, is sacrificing the whole population,.. he says. ...Mental and emotional health issues are on the rise like crazy now because kids have no ability to deal with things.

One was hospitalized, but officials would not release other health or personal details, citing privacy reasons....The message is that measles is circulating in Toronto,.. said Dr. Lisa Berger, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. ...There has been spread somewhere...Berger said that in three of the four cases, the individuals had not been vaccinated against the disease. In the fourth case, the person received only one dose of the double-dose vaccination, she said.None are from the same family and there is no source case, said Berger....It's always concerning to me when we get cases of a disease that has been eliminated in Ontario,.. said Dr. Shelley Deeks, medical director of Immunization and Vaccine Preventable Diseases with Public Health Ontario.The last endemic case of measles in Canada was in 1997, with recent outbreaks the result of imported viruses from endemic regions, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.In Ontario, the number of reported cases per year has fluctuated from three to 22 over the past five years, said Deeks....Will I be surprised if we see subsequent cases from this? Absolutely not,.. said Deeks.The Toronto outbreak is the first in Ontario this year.It comes just days after a measles outbreak that originated at Disneyland in December spread to 100 people.Berger said none of the victims had travelled outside Toronto in the past 21 days, nor had they been in contact with anyone who had travelled.Canadian children typically receive two doses of the combined measles vaccine -  MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) and MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox) -  which is more than 90 percent effective.Deeks said that in Ontario, vaccination rates have hovered around 95 per cent for 17-year-olds for the past five years. However, Ontario has seen a ...slight increase.. of ...conscientious objectors.. to vaccines in recent years.Jane Heffernan, associate professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at York University and director of the Centre for Disease Modelling, said people may oppose vaccinating children because the effects of diseases are less visible today than they once were....We don't see very many cases now, and that may, in some people's minds, sway them to be more hesitant towards having their children vaccinated .._ because it's hard to assess the risk of infection when you don't see it,.. she said.Controversial anti-vaccine movements have gained attention in recent years, notably after actress Jenny McCarthy linked vaccinations with her son's autism, which is not supported by scientific evidence.On Monday, Health Minister Eric Hoskins said parents who don't get their children vaccinated for measles risk boosting the spread of the ""dangerous"" disease.""Parents really need to look at the evidence ... we need to continue to educate the population,"" he told reporters. ""There are gains that can be made.""Ontario children must be vaccinated against measles to attend school -  however, parents may submit a statement of conscience or religious belief to exempt children from vaccine requirements.Toronto Public Health is urging Torontonians to check their medical records to ensure they are fully vaccinated. People who show symptoms should call their health-care provider and notify medical offices before showing up.Measles is a highly contagious, potentially fatal disease. Symptoms include a high fever, cold-like symptoms, sore eyes or sensitivity to light and a red rash that starts on the face and neck and spreads to the rest of the body. Serious cases can result in pneumonia, blindness, and encephalitis -  swelling of the brain -  which can lead to death.Most people recover within 10 days.The TPH investigation into the outbreak is ongoing, said Berger.",19.44,6.51,3.03,3.33,14.67,12.25,3.78,2.57,3.78,1.21,5.75,6.35,0,0,0.15,0,3.03,1,0

41,0,"WASHINGTON ... President Obama on Tuesday rejected an attempt by lawmakers to force his hand on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, using his veto pen to sweep aside one of the first major challenges to his authority by the new Republican Congress.With no fanfare and a 104-word letter to the Senate, Mr. Obama vetoed legislation to authorize construction of a 1,179-mile pipeline that would carry 800,000 barrels of heavy petroleum a day from the oil sands of Alberta to ports and refineries on the Gulf Coast.In exercising the unique power of the Oval Office for only the third time since his election in 2008, Mr. Obama accused lawmakers of seeking to circumvent the administration..È approval process for the pipeline by cutting short ...consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest...By rejecting the legislation, Mr. Obama retains the right to make a final judgment on the pipeline on his own timeline. But he did little to calm the political debate over Keystone, which has become a symbol of the continuing struggle between environmentalists and conservatives. Backers of the pipeline denounced Mr. Obama..È actions and vowed to keep fighting for its construction.The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, called the president..È veto ...a national embarrassment.. and accused Mr. Obama of being ...too close to environmental extremists.. and ...too invested in left-fringe politics...Environmentalists quickly hailed the decision, which they said clearly indicated Mr. Obama..È intention to reject the pipeline..È construction. The White House has said the president will decide whether to allow the pipeline when all of the environmental reviews are completed in the coming weeks....Republicans in Congress continued to waste everyone..È time with a bill destined to go nowhere, just to satisfy the agenda of their big oil allies,.. said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. ...The president has all the evidence he needs to reject Keystone XL now, and we are confident that he will...Since 2011, the proposed Keystone pipeline has emerged as a broader symbol of the partisan political clash over energy, climate change and the economy.Most energy policy experts say the project will have a minimal impact on jobs and climate. But Republicans insist that the pipeline will increase employment by linking the United States to an energy supply from a friendly neighbor. Environmentalists say it will contribute to ecological destruction and damaging climate change.Mr. Obama has hinted that he thinks both sides have inflated their arguments, but he has not said what he will decide.In his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Obama urged lawmakers to move past the pipeline debate, calling for passage of a comprehensive infrastructure plan. ...Let..È set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,.. he said.Republican leaders had promised to use the veto, which was expected, to denounce Mr. Obama as a partisan obstructionist. They made good on that promise minutes after the president..È veto message was read on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday....The fact he vetoed the bipartisan Keystone Pipeline in private shows how out of step he is with the priorities of the American people, who overwhelmingly support this vital jobs and infrastructure project,.. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.In recent months, the environmental activists ... who have spent years marching, protesting and getting arrested outside the White House in their quest to persuade Mr. Obama to reject the project ... have said they are increasingly optimistic that their efforts will succeed....Hopefully the ongoing legislative charade has strengthened his commitment to do the right thing,.. said Bill McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, which has led the campaign to urge Mr. Obama to reject the pipeline.The debate began in 2008, when the TransCanada Corporation applied for a permit to construct the pipeline. The State Department is required to determine whether the pipeline is in the national interest, but the last word on whether the project will go forward ultimately rests with the president.Mr. Obama has delayed making that decision until all the legal and environmental reviews of the process are completed. He has said a critical factor in his decision will be whether the project contributes to climate change.more carbon pollution than conventionally extracted oil.But the review said the pipeline was unlikely to contribute to a significant increase in planet-warming greenhouse gases because the fuel would probably be extracted from the oil sands and sold with or without construction of the pipeline.This month, environmentalists pointed to a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency that they said proved that the pipeline could add to greenhouse gases.The question of whether to build the pipeline comes as Mr. Obama hopes to make climate change policy a cornerstone of his legacy. This summer, the E.P.A. is expected to issue sweeping regulations to cut greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, a move experts say would have vastly more impact on the nation..È carbon footprint than construction of the Keystone pipeline.In December, world leaders hope to sign a global United Nations accord in Paris that would commit every nation in the world to enacting plans to reduce its rates of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. In the coming months, countries are expected to begin putting forward those policies for cutting carbon emissions.While the Keystone pipeline is not expected to be part of the United States climate change plan, a public presidential decision on the project could be interpreted as a message about Mr. Obama..È symbolic commitment to the issue of climate change.Until that decision is made, however, both sides of the Keystone fight are stepping up their tactics. Environmental groups are planning more marches and White House petitions, while Republicans in Congress are looking for ways to bring the Keystone measure back to Mr. Obama..È desk.Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who sponsored the Keystone bill, said he would consider adding language requiring construction of the pipeline to other legislation, such as spending bills to fund federal agencies, which could make a veto far more politically risky for Mr. Obama.A final decision by the president could come soon. Last month, a court in Nebraska reached a verdict in a case about the pipeline..È route through the state, clearing the way for construction. And this month, final reviews of the pipeline by eight federal agencies were completed.However, Mr. Obama is under no legal obligation to make a final decision, and there is no official timetable for a decision. He could approve or deny the project at any time ... or leave the decision to the next president.",24.87,5.9,3.04,2.86,15.19,11.17,4.02,1.88,3.75,1.61,5.81,4.65,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,0
42,0,"VATICAN CITY -  Pope Francis on Thursday called for a radical transformation of politics, economics and individual lifestyles to confront environmental degradation and climate change, blending a biting critique of consumerism and irresponsible development with a plea for swift and unified global action.The vision that Francis outlined in a 184-page papal encyclical is sweeping in ambition and scope: He describes relentless exploitation and destruction of the environment and says apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness are to blame.The most vulnerable victims, he declares, are the world's poorest people, who are being dislocated and disregarded.Francis, the first pope from the developing world, used the encyclical -  titled ...Laudato Si',.. or ...Praise Be to You.. -  to highlight the crisis posed by climate change. He places most of the blame on fossil fuels and human activity, while warning of an ...unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us.. if corrective action is not taken swiftly. Developed, industrialized countries were mostly responsible, he says, and are obligated to help poorer nations confront the crisis....Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods,.. he writes. ...It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day...The Vatican released the encyclical at noon on Thursday, three days after an Italian magazine posted a leaked draft online, to the fury of Vatican officials. The breach led to speculation that opponents of Francis in the Vatican wanted to embarrass him by undermining the release.Even so, religious figures, environmentalists, scientists, executives and elected officials around the world awaited the official release, and scheduled news conferences or issued statements afterward. News media interest was enormous, in part because of Francis' global popularity, but also because of the intriguing coalition he is proposing between faith and science....Humanity is faced with a crucial challenge that requires the development of adequate policies, which, moreover, are currently being discussed on the global agenda,.. Cardinal Peter Turkson said at a news conference at the Vatican. ...Certainly, ...Laudato Si' ' can and must have an impact on important and urgent decisions to be made in this area...Francis has made it clear that he hopes the encyclical will influence energy and economic policy and stir a global movement. He calls on ordinary people to press politicians for change. Catholic bishops and priests around the world are expected to discuss the encyclical in services on Sunday. But Francis is also reaching for a wider audience, asking in the document ...to address every person living on this planet...Even before the encyclical, the pope's stance against environmental destruction and his demand for global action had already thrilled many scientists. Advocates of policies to combat climate change have said they hoped that Francis could lend a ...moral dimension.. to the debate....Within the scientific community, there is almost a code of honor that you will never transgress the red line between pure analysis and moral issues,.. said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder and chairman of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ...But we are now in a situation where we have to think about the consequences of our insight for society...Francis has been sharply criticized by those who question or deny the established science of human-caused climate change, and also by some conservative Roman Catholics, who see the encyclical as an attack on capitalism and as political meddling.Governments are now developing domestic climate-change plans to prepare for a United Nations summit meeting on the issue in Paris in December. The meeting's goal is to achieve a sweeping accord in which every nation would commit to new policies to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. Many governments have yet to present plans, including major emitters like Brazil, which has a large Catholic population. The encyclical is seen as an unsubtle nudge for action....It gives a lot of cover to political and economic leaders in those countries, as they make decisions on climate change policy,.. said Timothy Wirth, vice chairman of the United Nations Foundation.Catholic theologians say the overarching theme of the encyclical is ...integral ecology,.. which links care for the environment with a notion already well developed in Catholic teaching: that economic development, to be morally good and just, must take into account people's need for things like freedom, education and meaningful work....The basic idea is, in order to love God, you have to love your fellow human beings, and you have to love and care for the rest of creation,.. said Vincent Miller, who holds a chair in Catholic theology and culture at the University of Dayton, a Catholic college in Ohio. ...It gives Francis a very traditional basis to argue for the inclusion of environmental concern at the center of Christian faith...He added: ...Critics will say the church can't teach policy, the church can't teach politics. And Francis is saying, ...No, these things are at the core of the church's teaching.' ..Francis tapped a wide variety of sources in his encyclical, partly to underscore the universality of his message. He cites passages from his two papal predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, and draws prominently from a religious ally, Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He also cites a ninth-century Sufi mystic, Ali al-Khawas.The pope begins the encyclical with a hymn by St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals and the environment. He used the Book of Genesis to underpin his theological argument. But in a passage certain to rankle some Christians, he chastises those who cite Genesis as evidence that man has ...dominion.. over the earth that justifies practices like mountaintop mining or fishing with gill nets....This is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the Church,.. Francis writes. The Bible teaches human beings to ...till and keep.. the garden of the world, he says. ... ...Tilling' refers to cultivating, plowing or working, while ...keeping' means caring, protecting, overseeing and preserving...His most stinging rebuke is a broad critique of profit-seeking and the undue influence of technology on society. He praises achievements in medicine, science and engineering, but says that ...our immense technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human responsibility, values and conscience...Central to Francis' theme is the link between poverty and the planet's fragility. The pope rejects the belief that technology and ...current economics.. will solve environmental problems, or ...that the problems of global hunger and poverty will be resolved simply by market growth......A huge indictment I see in this encyclical is that people have lost their sense of ultimate and proper goals of technology and economics,.. said Christiana Z. Peppard, an assistant professor of theology, science and ethics at Fordham University in New York. ...We are focused on short-term, consumerist patterns...Encyclicals are letters to the clergy and laity of the church that are considered authoritative. Catholics are expected to try to sincerely embrace their teachings. But more specific assertions in them can be categorized as ...prudential judgments,.. a phrase that some critics have invoked to reject Francis' positions on issues like climate change or economic inequality.Many conservatives will be pleased with the encyclical's strong criticism of abortion, and its dismissal of arguments that population control can be an answer to poverty. However, Francis sharply criticizes the trading of carbon credits -  a market-based system central to the European Union's climate policy -  and says it ...may simply become a ploy which permits maintaining the excessive consumption of some countries and sectors...Above all, Francis frames the encyclical as a call to action. He praises young people for being ready for change, and said ...enforceable international agreements are urgently needed... He cites Benedict in saying that advanced societies ...must be prepared to encourage more sober lifestyles, while reducing their energy consumption and improving its efficiency......All is not lost,.. he writes. ...Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start...",22.57,6.72,3.4,3.32,14.84,10.12,6.57,2.07,3.25,2.44,4.43,6.72,0.3,0,0,0,4.87,0,0
43,0,"WASHINGTON ... In the early months of 2014, a group of about 30 corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists and Republican political strategists began meeting regularly in the headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, often, according to some of the participants, in a conference room overlooking the White House. Their task was to start devising a legal strategy for dismantling the climate change regulations they feared were coming from President Obama.The group ... headed in part by Roger R. Martella Jr., a top environmental official in the George W. Bush administration, and Peter Glaser, a prominent Washington lobbyist ... was getting an early start.By the time Mr. Obama announced the regulations at the White House on Monday, the small group that had begun its work at the Chamber of Commerce had expanded into a vast network of lawyers and lobbyists ranging from state capitols to Capitol Hill, aided by Republican governors and congressional leaders. And their plan was to challenge Mr. Obama at every opportunity and take the fight against what, if enacted, would be one of his signature accomplishments to the Supreme Court.Within minutes of the announcement, West Virginia..È attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, stepped before a bank of cameras for a news conference at the Greenbrier resort in his home state. Flanked by Mike Duncan, the president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, one of the nation..È top coal lobbying groups, and Greg Zoeller, the attorney general of Indiana, Mr. Morrisey announced that a group of at least 15 Republican state attorneys general were preparing to jointly file a legal challenge to Mr. Obama..È proposal....The final rule announced Monday blatantly disregards the rule of law and will severely harm West Virginia and the U.S. economy,.. Mr. Morrisey said. ...This rule represents the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation..È history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats and based on an obscure, rarely used provision of the Clean Air Act......Our coalition, in short order, will comprise of many states, consumers, mine workers, coal operators, utilities and businesses who are united in opposition to this radical and illegal policy,.. he added.While Mr. Obama had not even put forth a draft proposal of his plans when the group started its work, the president had made plain in several speeches that he intended to act forcefully on climate change ... and that he would flex the muscle of his executive authority to do so. ...If Congress won..È act soon to protect future generations, I will,.. he said in his 2013 State of the Union address. The lawyers and lobbyists wanted to be ready to fire back hard and fast when he did.In devising its strategy, the group worked closely with the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader whose coal-producing home state also stands to suffer under the regulation. While Mr. McConnell opposes the climate change regulations, his advisers knew that he had little chance of enacting legislation to block them in Congress. Instead, Mr. McConnell has taken the unusual step of reaching out directly to governors and attorneys general, urging them to refuse to submit compliance plans for the regulations, and encouraging a state-by-state rejection of the rules.Mr. Morrisey, whose coal-producing home state is also struggling with the nation..È highest unemployment rate, was chosen as the public face of the suit. But key strategists joining the original planning were Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a former attorney general there, and Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma. Both already had experience suing the Obama administration over major Clean Air Act regulations.An important ally in the effort was the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a conservative advocacy group that pushes policy through state legislatures. Typically, the council..È committees of corporate members will craft a model bill designed to push through policies it supports, such as rolling back environmental regulations.At a July meeting in San Diego, ALEC..È energy committee ... which includes Mr. Duncan, the coal lobbyist who also worked closely with Mr. McConnell on his tactics ... enacted a model bill designed to directly support state attorneys general who legally challenge the climate change plan. According to a person present at that July meeting, the bill would allow states to create funds, which could be funded by corporate donations, to support legal challenges to the climate change rules.While it is not unusual for major corporations to sue the federal government over environmental regulations, people involved in the effort to craft a legal strategy against the climate change rules said the time, labor and coordination of the effort were unusual. That effort reflects the sweeping scope of climate change regulations, which, unless struck down in the Supreme Court, could transform huge sectors of the economy, potentially crippling the coal industry and other industrial sectors whose economic well-being relies on coal.The Obama administration contends that despite the massive scale of the challenges trained against it, the climate change plan is legally sound. ...The final rule is built on a rock-solid legal foundation,.. said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the agency....E.P.A. is using its clear authority under the Clean Air Act to set emission standards for air pollutants,.. he said. ...The rule is wholly consistent with the law, and we are confident it will withstand any and all legal challenges...But Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who has worked closely with the group, says that the attorneys general will not back down. ...This rule was more aggressive than any of us could have imagined,.. he said. ...There is no lack of state attorneys general who would like to put a bullet in this thing... The rules, a final, stricter version of a plan that the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2012 and 2014, assigns each state a target for reducing its carbon pollution from power plants. States will be allowed to create their own plans to meet the requirements and will have to submit initial versions of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018.The most aggressive of the regulations requires that by 2030, the nation..È existing power plants must cut emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels, which is an increase from the 30 percent target proposed in the draft regulation.The president on Monday called the new rules a public health imperative and ...the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change... He also sought to wrap the policy in the legitimacy of transcendental values, noting that Pope Francis issued an encyclical in June, calling action on the issue a ...moral obligation...Even as Mr. Obama acknowledged the steep resistance from coal-producing states and industry critics, he said it was up to the United States to adopt tough standards so that other countries like China would feel compelled to take similar steps.But Mr. McConnell made it clear he would do everything in his power to combat the rules, which he said the president had crafted because he was ...tired of having to work with the Congress the people elected......That..È why the administration is now trying to impose these deeply regressive regulations ... regulations that may be illegal, that won..È meaningfully impact the global environment, and that are likely to harm middle- and lower-class Americans most ... by executive fiat,.. Mr. McConnell said. ...It represents a triumph of blind ideology over sound policy and honest compassion,.. he added.",27.67,7.07,2.73,4.34,14.3,9.56,4.18,2.33,4.66,1.04,5.3,6.43,0,0,0,0,2.25,0,0
44,0,"Parts of the eastern United States, already hit by heavy rains that have caused flooding, prepared on Thursday for even more rain as Hurricane Joaquin churned through the Bahamas on a path that could unleash more stormy weather and flooding along the Atlantic Coast.The National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory that it had upgraded the storm to an ...extremely dangerous.. Category 4 hurricane. It has maximum sustained winds near 130 miles per hour, with strengthening possible in the next 24 hours.It is expected during that period to turn toward the west and north on Thursday night, passing near or over portions of the northwestern Bahamas on Friday.While forecasters say they have yet to pin down whether the storm will hit the Eastern Seaboard, many states are bracing for its fallout. Rain and winds have been buffeting much of the East Coast this week and they are likely to continue for the next few days, even if the center of Joaquin stays offshore, the center said. Two of the more reliable tracking models keep Joaquin offshore.That uncertainty has prompted officials in states along the Atlantic to urge residents to take precautions. Several governors have declared a state of emergency for their state.In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory has ordered state agencies to prepare for flooding in the state, which is already saturated by another storm system that unleashed several inches of rain. The emergency management agency said five to seven inches of rain could fall Thursday through Saturday, with more on Sunday as the hurricane nears. Some forecasts say that portions of the Carolinas could get up to 20 inches of rain.In a news conference, Mr. McCrory said nearly the entire state was under flood watch even before Hurricane Joaquin. Equipment and boats were being prepared in case evacuations were needed. Crews from central Pennsylvania were on standby in case they needed to supplement any evacuation or clearing efforts on the coast....We hope that we have to respond to nothing,.. he said in a news conference.Referring to the hurricane..È path, he said, ...The projections are all over the place at this point and time......In the next 10-24 hours we will get more direction,.. he said.He said they were most concerned about the eastern parts of the state and the coastal Outer Banks, but the storm had the potential to affect the mountain areas, because of the potential of flooding streams.In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, allowing state and local emergency responders to begin to prepare for the eight to 10 inches of rain forecast for Thursday and Friday, as well as for any effect on the state from Hurricane Joaquin, a statement said.The governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, who is running for the Republican nomination for president, also declared a state of emergency and canceled campaign events for the weekend ahead to focus on the storm.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York activated the state emergency operations center in Albany in anticipation of heavy rain, high winds, coastal flooding and power failures as the hurricane makes its way up the coast, a statement said.In South Carolina, the state..È emergency management division distributed the hurricane guide online including coastal evacuation maps, information about how to stay connected, and advice on storing bottled water and nonperishable food....There..È a lot of uncertainty in the forecasts from the National Hurricane Center,.. the division director, Kim Stenson, said in a statement. ...We are preparing for the possibility that this storm could affect South Carolina, we..Èe asking residents to do the same...Officials in Pennsylvania urged residents to watch for flooding and strong winds. ...We are several days away from any impact from Hurricane Joaquin, but we..Èe expecting more rain this weekend so if you live in a flood-prone area, get ready,.. said Richard D. Flinn Jr., director of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.The Delaware Emergency Management Agency said it was monitoring the potential for coastal and inland flooding over the next several days as well as the track of the hurricane.The National Hurricane Center said the forecasts were not definitive....Confidence in the details of the forecast after 72 hours remains low, as there have been some large changes in the model guidance overnight,.. the center said. ...The range of possible outcomes is still large, and the possibility of a hurricane landfall in the Carolinas still cannot be ruled out...Wherever the hurricane landed, the center said, ...minor to moderate coastal flooding.. could be expected in the Mid-Atlantic States and Northeast throughout the weekend.The Bahamas will bear the brunt of the storm until at least Friday, as the storm drifts southwest before turning north to pummel the country..È central islands. Storm surges of five to eight feet were expected, forecasters said, and rainfall could total as much as 20 inches.In general, the hurricane will start to head north from the Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center said a path toward the northwest and north is expected on Friday, and a faster motion toward the north is expected Friday night and Saturday.But some of the data models that forecasters use, gleaned from aerial surveillance missions, show several possibilities for where the hurricane goes next.One shows the possibility of the hurricane taking a sharp westward turn over the Carolinas in three to four days. Another model suggests that the hurricane will track toward Long Island and southern New England in five days.A further possibility is that Hurricane Joaquin will move further east into the ocean in four to five days.",20.96,4.67,1.8,2.86,17.29,10.6,5.09,2.23,5.2,0.53,4.98,5.3,0,0,0,0,2.12,1,0

So Seattle residents are given different bins to put out on the curb ... one for yard and food waste, another for recycling ... and are encouraged to use ever-tinier cans for the stuff that really is trash.The rules were given teeth this year, when Seattle became one of the first cities in the nation to penalize residents for sorting poorly. If, on inspection, more than 10 percent of a garbage can..È contents should have properly been in another kind of bin, the trash collector can pin a bright red tag on the offender..È receptacle. Financial penalties have been authorized but not yet levied. A primary goal of the policy is to keep people from throwing food and recyclable materials into trash cans.This week, a group of Seattle residents ... while stressing that they agreed with the city..È goals ... said the inspections violated their privacy, as protected by the Washington State Constitution. What people toss away, the group argued in a lawsuit filed on Thursday, is still theirs to protect, however much, especially in these warm days of summer and rot, they might want to get rid of it all as soon as possible.PhotoEthan Blevins, foreground, a lawyer, led a news conference Thursday in Seattle. A group of residents, while agreeing with the city..È goals, filed a lawsuit saying inspection rules go too far. Credit Ken Lambert/The Seattle Times...This case is not about composting ... this is about tossing our privacy rights in the garbage,.. said Sally Oljar, 60, a graphic designer and one of the plaintiffs. ...An admirable goal does not justify a bad policy,.. she added.A lawyer for the city, John Schochet, declined to comment, saying his office was still studying the lawsuit.Other cities, including San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, have statutes requiring residents to keep food waste out of the garbage, though neither has a mechanism of enforcement like Seattle..È. And some cities, including La Crosse, Wis., have experimented with cameras that track what comes out of a bin when it is dumped.What constitutes improper snooping in the trash is a question that courts have dug into before. The United States Supreme Court, in a case in 1988, said that the decision to throw something away effectively puts that object into the public domain. The police do not need a warrant, the court ruled, to grab a suspect..È garbage and take it down to the station for examination in a drug case.But lawyers for the plaintiffs in Seattle said that Washington law has mostly gone the other way. The state Constitution, they said, has stringent and specific language about privacy. And the Washington Supreme Court held in a case in 1990 that law enforcement officials needed a warrant to search a suspect..È trash for evidence in a criminal case....A person has a legitimate expectation that the contents of his or her garbage cans will remain private,.. said the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in King County Superior Court. The eight plaintiffs are represented free of charge by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit, conservative group that advocates property rights and limited government.But if residents and businesses can be driven to distraction by garbage sorting, Seattle-style, pity even more the poor garbage collector.What, after all, is 10 percent? And how should it be calculated? A training manual for trash collection workers, posted by the plaintiffs in their lawsuit, suggests gauging the percentage by visually dividing a can into 10 segments. ...Use good judgment,.. the training guide says. Trash workers cannot tear into a bag to search, the manual says, but must judge only on what they can see, either through clear plastic or after the contents have been dumped into the truck.Formal legal proof of a 10 percent violation, the lawsuit said, would require hard math: The radius squared and the height of the can would have to be multiplied by Pi (3.14, not Pie, as in a thrown-away dessert) and then divided by 10. And even before then, the plaintiffs and their lawyers said, the sorting of what goes where can be complicated....I try to police our garbage,.. said Brian T.

And once the insect buries itself inside a shipment, it becomes a haven for bacteria.In the more severe cases, infested seeds can lose up to 70 per cent of their weight....They are difficult to control once they are established somewhere because they will attack any kind of stored product,.. said St.©phanie Boucher, an entomologist at McGill University. Wheat, barley, rice, flower, pasta and even chocolate, she said, are all seen as food by the beetle.While eating a single Khapra beetle won't poison you, ingesting a large quantity of them could chafe your stomach lining, Boucher said. The bugs are covered with sharp, reddish-brown hairs.The beetle, native to India, is also incredibly hard to kill. In California, where the species was first spotted in 1953, it took 13 years and $15 million to eradicate the bug. Many types of insecticide won't have any effect, and the beetle can hide easily by burying itself in damaged grains....They are a major pest causing great loss of product,.. Boucher said. ...They will damage the grain, they will accelerate the mold and bacteria infestation. There are many parts of the world where they are stuck with this pest...The Khapra beetle is currently not established in Canada.

52,0,"AL AZRAQ REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan -  Here in Jordan's vast northeastern desert, row after row of white steel shelters built specially for Syrian refugees sit empty.Storefronts lining a street designed to mimic an urban souk are shuttered, the silence broken only by the punishing wind that is infamous here. Layers of sand coat the windows and floors.Syrian families live in other parts of the camp, one of the only places left in Jordan where most new refugees are allowed to settle. But nearly 11 months after the camp opened, there are many areas that are deserted.It was not supposed to be this way.Built with tens of millions of dollars of international donor money, Azraq was meant to solve myriad problems for both Jordan and the Syrians who have flooded over the border since civil war began to tear apart their country in 2011.For Jordan, the camp was expected to relieve the burden that hundreds of thousands of displaced Syrians are placing on the country's fragile economy and crowded cities. For the refugees, Azraq was expected to be something of a step up despite its remoteness, a better-planned camp designed around ...villages.. where people from the same Syrian towns and cities could cluster near shared schools and playgrounds.Despite the good intentions, only about 14,500 refugees have settled here, although at least 60,000 had been expected to live at the camp by the end of last year.The shortfall in the number is symbolic of a wider breakdown in the international system to save Syrians from a war that is entering its fifth year, with more neighboring countries making it harder for Syrians to flee across their borders and Western countries cutting back on aid and still mainly unwilling to resettle large numbers of the refugees....If we had the rate of arrivals that we had in 2012, Azraq today would have 200,000 people,.. said Davide Terzi, Jordan's chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration, the agency responsible for the transfer of refugees from the border area to refugee camps.The main reason that Azraq is so empty, at least so far, appears to be fear. The camp opened last April, after Islamic State militants seized significant territory in Syria and became a dangerous new factor in the war, raising anxiety that its fighters would cross into Jordan along with refugees. After years when hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Syrians were allowed into Jordan each week, the kingdom has slowed that flood to a relative trickle.Another reason for the slowdown, the United Nations refugee agency says, is Jordan's worry that donor fatigue will leave it to care for a refugee population that is beginning to feel permanent, or at least long-term.That fear rose in December, after a drop in donor funding led the World Food Program to briefly warn that it would have to cut off food aid for the hundreds of thousands living outside the camps.But Azraq's desolation has also complicated efforts to fill the camp. Of the more than 35,000 refugees brought to the camp, around 19,000 have left, starving the camp of the thriving street life that was supposed to entice people to stay, according to data provided by the government and aid agencies....When I first arrived and saw the camp, I almost had a heart attack,.. said Ahmad Abed Rabo, 79, who arrived with his family last July. ...The sense of emptiness and uncertainty overwhelmed me...More troubling for Jordan, aid agencies say the vast majority of those who left the camp settled illegally in the very cities and towns the camp was built to relieve. (At least 625,000 Syrians have settled in Jordan since the war started, and only about 100,000 are in camps, according to the United Nations refugee agency.)At least in public, donors who poured money into the camp are not pushing Jordan -  an active ally in the military fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL -  to change its policies. Money spent on Azraq, they say, is part of a broader policy of supporting Jordan as it struggles to maintain its security in a turbulent region....There are hard choices to be made by the Jordanian government, and we understand,.. Mr. Terzi said in an interview. ...National security is paramount...When Azraq opened, it was one of four camps housing displaced Syrians. The largest camp, Zaatari, opened in 2012 and was initially known for its crime and chaos. Azraq was, in some ways, envisioned as the anti-Zaatari, a better-designed camp meant to build a cohesive community.To avoid Zaatari's cramped quarters, Azraq is four times the size and was designed with precision, rather than piecemeal as Zaatari was at a time when Jordan was scrambling to house the early flood of refugees.Azraq's designers have succeeded in some ways. Security has never been a big issue here, as it was at Zaatari, in part because of more policing.Azraq also has a well-equipped hospital and a well-stocked supermarket, where refugees can spend food coupons provided by the World Food Program to buy hunks of cheese, olive oil, rice and nuts, reminders of home. And rather than the tents used at Zaatari, small shelters designed to better withstand heat and wind house Azraq's residents.Still, life in the camp is routinely harsh. There is electricity provided by generators only in very limited areas. Refugees, many of them former city dwellers, worry about the scorpions, and about snakes they fear will be attracted by the mice that have already overrun the camp.But perhaps the biggest complaint is the lack of bustle that would naturally accompany a larger population....Azraq still needs to get that sense of community,.. said Andrew Harper, the top official with the United Nations refugee agency in Jordan.In addition to the more than 80,000 Syrians at Zaatari, a bustling street market created and run by the refugees has contributed to what aid officials and refugees call a sense of ...dignity......The market is where people meet and drink tea,.. said Jina Krause-Vilmar, director at the Near East Foundation, a nonprofit organization helping vulnerable communities. ...It's where a sense of community is established...The street market at Azraq would go a long way toward relieving the bleakness, but it remains unopened, according to the United Nations and the spokesman for the Jordanian government, Mohammad Momani, because the government wants to impose taxes and possibly other fees on those who set up businesses. (Mr. Momani said he expected the market to open soon.)A man who would identify himself only as Abu Eiad, 51, is one of those who left the camp, in his case for a northern Jordanian town. He arrived last June from Damascus after a grueling journey with two of his remaining three children. A son who joined the Free Syrian Army, an armed group fighting the Syrian government, had already been killed, and his wife died during fierce clashes on a visit to her family's hometown, Dara'a.But after living in the camp for one month, he could not take the rough conditions. He said he left legally through a temporary travel permit, but never returned....My health was deteriorating,.. he said. ...I couldn't take my kids out of the shelter at night because I was afraid they would be bitten by hyenas or vicious animals in the desert...Aid workers said the tide might be turning somewhat at Azraq, with a small number of refugees recently leaving cities and towns for the camp, but only because they are desperate. Living outside the camp, they receive considerably less international help than they do inside, where they are entitled to free health care and larger food rations.Abu Eiad said he would not be moving to the camp....It's true that I am living in poverty here and my son is not attending school,.. he said, referring to the town where he has been living, ...but if I was forced to leave this place, I would return to Syria, not to the camp...",24.36,6.6,2.86,3.74,15.98,12.98,4.77,4.18,5.21,2.71,4.25,7.26,0,0,0,0,2.05,1,0

54,0,"Until my 8-year-old granddaughter, Emilia, and I pretended to be tourists in New York, it had honestly never occurred to me that Times Square might be the nicest neighborhood in the city. At the places where out-of-towners go, I was struck by how many young employees of these attractions asked us if we were enjoying ourselves, if we were having fun. More surprisingly, they seemed genuinely interested in our replies. They appeared to have been hired for their humorous, friendly dispositions.I..Èe lived in New York almost all my life, but not once have so many strangers inquired after my welfare and happiness as they did during the snowy February weekend and the subsequent Sunday in early March during which Emilia and I played tourist.The project was Emilia..È idea. She..È at an age at which she has a spongelike relationship with information, and some of that new information concerns the city where she has lived all her life. She..È been saying she wanted to go to Times Square, where in fact she..È been ... we..È seen ...Matilda.. and ...The Lion King.. on Broadway ... but she didn..È know that. Maybe she was confused because Times Square was never presented to her as a destination, but rather as an obstacle course to be traversed between the subway and the theater.She also asked to go to the top of the Empire State Building, where I had never been, and to visit the Statue of Liberty, where I hadn..È been since a day-camp field trip, during the summer after fifth grade. And though she..È been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we agreed we..È go there so she could help her grandmother tell other children (and their families) what they might like to see.In fact, by the time we finished our pretend tour of New York, I wanted to urge all my out-of-town friends with children and grandchildren: Come visit! Bring the family! Whatever you..Èe heard about the city being crowded or dirty or unfriendly isn..È true. It..È a playground for young and old!Emilia and I started at the Empire State Building. The observatory entrance, on Fifth Avenue just south of 34th Street, is decorated with traces of Art Deco, a foretaste of the gleaming Art Deco sculptures and paneling employed throughout the building..È magnificent lobby. I..È been warned by friends to go early in the day. I..È also been advised to purchase tickets to the observatories (on the 86th and 102nd floor) online, in advance, so as to avoid the long lines and lengthy waits for the elevators.At 10 in the morning in the dead of winter, the lines weren..È especially long, and we could probably have done without the (expensive) advance tickets, but the pile-up at the security checkpoint and the roped-off mazes prepared to keep crowds inching along made us realize that on another day, at another time, our experience could have been very different. The elevator rides were fast and fun, and I loved the view from the open observatory on the 86th floor and the smaller, enclosed one, higher up.It was especially pleasant to take in the amazing 360-degree panorama without the crowds, which, I imagine, could make the observation deck feel like a rush-hour subway, 86 stories high. Emilia found the experience exciting, but less fun. She..È not an anxious or fearful child, but she is an honest one. She admitted that the view ... we could see all the way into Brooklyn and pick out the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, near where she lives ... was awesome. But there was something slightly sickening about looking down from that height. Once around each of the observatories and she was ready to go back down, though she smiled politely at the elevator operators and guards who asked if we had had a good time.Another thing we did in advance, and which I tell everyone with children living in New York or planning a trip here to do ahead, is buy tickets for a play at the New Victory Theater. On 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the New Victory is a vintage theater refurbished just enough to retain plenty of funky charm. It specializes in children..È programming, featuring theater groups from all over the world. The shows we..Èe liked best in the past have been the most circuslike.This time we watched a performance titled ...Cambuyon,.. featuring a troupe (from Barcelona and the Canary Islands) of tap and hip-hop dancers, vocalists and percussionists, a riveting succession of numbers including a singer who could imitate all the instruments in a band and a pair or dancers ... sisters, or Emilia thought, maybe twins ... who could give the impression of dislocating and reattaching every joint in their bodies. The theater is staffed by city teenagers who couldn..È be nicer; tickets are reasonably priced, refreshments cheap, and no one hawks costly corporate souvenirs during intermission.If we hadn..È had theater tickets for noon, we could have spent much longer at Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, which was not only far more enjoyable than I..È imagined but potentially educational: I would have liked to have had the time and leisure to tell Emilia more about some of the figures we encountered: Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro and the Dalai Lama, among many others. But perhaps it was better that I simply followed her around as she ran to see the exhibits that most interested her: Taylor Swift, Abraham Lincoln and Amelia Earhart, whom she had learned all about in school.After she overcame the initial creepiness (her word) of seeing people made of wax, she was in a state of pure delight. She asked to have her picture taken with ...Judy Garland.. as Dorothy in ...The Wizard of Oz,.. and would have climbed onto E.T...È bicycle if there hadn..È been a line.Flatteringly, she..È asked if there would be a statue of me. I said I imagined very few writers would be there, but in fact we saw likenesses of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Maya Angelou. It was interesting to see whom she recognized (Albert Einstein, Jimi Hendrix) and whom she didn..È (the Spice Girls and the Jonas Brothers are ancient history for an 8-year-old).But it was no surprise that her absolute favorite moment of our entire pretend-tourist excursion was the chance to have her picture taken with statues of the Beatles. She..È going through an intense Beatlemania phase, and it thrilled her to sit at the feet of her idols. In the elevator going down, a young museum employee asked what Emilia had liked best, and they had a lively conversation about the Beatles.As a responsible grandparent, I can usually hold out against requests for revolting quantities of sugar, but I..È be lying if I said we didn..È enjoy the Times Square M & M..È store, at Broadway and 49th Street, on the northern fringes of Times Square. The columns of colored candies (25,000 square feet of candy!) with levers that release precise helpings of sweetness into plastic bags had an amusing Willy Wonka fantasy element, and we promised each other (and, in absentia, Emilia..È mom and dad) that we would never again consume three-quarters of a pound of candy over a single weekend.Saving the sweets for dessert, we walked around the neighborhood until we found a place where we felt like having lunch. Emilia..È out-of-towner facade cracked to reveal the cosmopolitan Brooklynite when she asked if we could eat at the Thai restaurant, Pongsri, on 48th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, where she ordered (and ate all of) a delicious pad thai.As we traveled uptown to meet her grandpa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Emilia, who..È been there often, said that she would be our guide to what she considered the most child-friendly exhibits.I was glad to see that the Egyptian tombs and the hall of the medieval knights in armor were as thrilling to her as they..È been to me, when I was her age. She..È especially fond of the galleries off the equestrian armor hall, which feature the imposing and terrifying masks, helmets and body armor favored by Japanese samurais.Other big hits were the Temple of Dendur, where the large open areas, the windows looking out onto Central Park and the reflecting pool provide a welcome break from the more confining spaces of the traditional galleries.Emilia, who is half Mexican, feels a kind of national pride in the collection of brilliantly decorative gold jewelry made by the ancient civilizations that inhabited Central America. And the Michael C. Rockefeller wing ... with gigantic figures, as large as small buildings and fashioned by the Asmat, an ethnic group in New Guinea ... is a perennial favorite.As a general rule for museum-going with children, I prefer to see a couple of exhibits and then get out before exhaustion and boredom set in. But during this somewhat longer visit, Emilia handled the problem of visual-art overload (which even adults experience) by taking pictures with my phone (permitted, as long as there is no flash) of everything that caught her eye. At first I mistook this for a way of not really looking, but after a while I realized that it was her way of looking without having to worry about remembering what she..È seen.The public cafeteria in the basement of the museum was a major success, with excellent food and a wide array of choices. Apparently having learned from the fast-food industry..È creative approach to packaging, the museum allows kids to choose their food and arrange it in cardboard containers designed to look like yellow New York taxi cabs.Emilia was excited about our trip to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. She prepared by reading a children..È book, ...You Wouldn..È Want to Be a Worker on the Statue of Liberty,.. part of a witty and informative series, each emphasizing the hardship of building various world monuments (the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids). She had learned many interesting facts: Did I know that the statue used to be the color of a new penny?Even on a cold and windy Sunday morning in March, the ferries to Lady Liberty and from there to Ellis Island and home were mobbed with tourists, the majority of whom seemed to have come from Europe and Asia. The ferry rides were brief and pleasant, in fact so brief I spent a good part of the trip from Battery Park to Liberty Island waiting in line for a soda at the snack bar.To reach the statue..È pedestal required us to pass through tight security twice, once before boarding the boat and once at the entrance to the statue. And by the time we finished waiting on windy docks, shuffling slowly forward in crowds and being instructed to remove our watches and sweaters, I felt I was not only visiting the scene of my great-grandparents..Èarrival at Ellis Island, but partly reliving it, minus the anti-lice fumigation and the mandatory dental exam.In advance of our trip to the statue, we bought ...platform access.. tickets, which required a somewhat arduous climb up flights of stairs (the elevator seemed not to be working) at the end of which we were able to step out on a rather narrow platform from which we could see more of the New York skyline and the harbor, and less of the statue than we had from the ground. Happily, tickets to Lady Liberty..È crown, which involves a very long climb, were not available until the beginning of June.Tickets to the Statue of Liberty allow passengers to take three ferry trips: from downtown Manhattan to Liberty Island, from there to Ellis Island, and back to Manhattan, though it..È possible to skip the Ellis Island portion and remain on the boat. On the day of our excursion, the ferry rides and the waits in line to board the boats were approximately the same length.The Ellis Island Museum is housed in a historic and fascinatingly evocative structure; the restoration has preserved many of the original tiles and architectural details. And in the enormous, high-ceilinged registry room, we got the sense of what it might have been like to wait for one..È name to be called by immigration officials. But the museum exhibits (mostly large placards and captions) seemed old-fashioned and a little tired, and while a tech-savvy 8-year-old was able to figure out how the guided audio tour worked, her grandmother was not.CONTINUE READING THE MAIN STORY22COMMENTSOur experience as pretend tourists occupied the better part of two days. We could have done it in a weekend if bad weather hadn..È forced us to wait two weeks between our trips to Times Square and the Statue of Liberty. The best part of the second day, we both agreed, was the ferry ride to Liberty Island.As the statue comes slowly into view it..È impossible not to be struck by how beautiful, how powerfully meaningful, it is; and I found it moving to approach Ellis Island by boat and to know that my ancestors had made a similar journey during the first decade of the 20th century.By the end of the day (a day during which I decided that if I were ever to do it again, let..È say when my 6-month-old grandson wants to play tourist, I..È go early on a weekday morning) I felt much as I imagine my great-grandmother must have felt at the end of her voyage: grateful and relieved.

55,0,"WARSAW ... Even though the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been asked to accept just a tiny fraction of the refugees that Germany and other nations are taking, their fierce resistance now stands as the main impediment to a unified European response to the crisis.Poland..È new president, Andrzej Duda, has complained about ...dictates.. from the European Union to accept migrants flowing onto the Continent from the Middle East and Africa.Slovakia..È prime minister, Robert Fico, says his country will accept only Christian refugees as it would be ...false solidarity.. to force Muslims to settle in a country without a single mosque. Viktor Orban, Hungary..È hard-line prime minister, calls the influx a ...rebellion by illegal migrants.. and pledges a new crackdown this week.The discord has further unsettled a union already shaky from struggles over the euro and the Greek financial crisis and now facing a historic influx of people attracted by Europe..È relative peace and prosperity.When representatives of the European Union nations meet on Monday to take up a proposal for allocating refugees among them, Central and Eastern European nations are likely to be the most vocal opponents. Their stance ... reflecting a mix of powerful far-right movements, nationalism, racial and religious prejudices as well as economic arguments that they are less able to afford to take in outsiders than their wealthier neighbors ... is the latest evidence of the stubborn cultural and political divides that persist between East and West.When joining the European Union ... as the former Communist countries have done since 2004 ... nations are asked to pledge support to a raft of so-called European values, including open markets, transparent government, respect for an independent media, open borders, cultural diversity, protection of minorities and a rejection of xenophobia.But the reality is that the former Communist states have proved sluggish in actually absorbing many of these values and practicing them. Oligarchs, cronyism and endemic corruption remain a part of daily life in many of the countries, freedom of the press is in decline while rising nationalism and populist political movements have stirred anti-immigrant tensions....People must remember that Poland has been transitioning from communism for only 25 years,.. Lech Walesa, who led that country..È independence movement, said in an interview. ...Our salaries and houses are still smaller than those in the West. Many people here don..È believe that they have anything to share with migrants. Especially that they see that migrants are often well-dressed, sometimes better than many Poles...Few migrants, in fact, are particularly interested in settling in Eastern Europe, preferring to head to Germany or Scandinavia, where social welfare benefits are higher, employment opportunities greater and immigrant communities better established. In that sense, migrants are aligned with leaders in Eastern and Central European capitals, who frequently argue that the 28-member bloc should focus first on securing its borders and figuring out a way to end the war in Syria before talking about mandatory quotas for accepting refugees.But as often as not, the political discourse in these countries has quickly moved toward a wariness of accepting racial and religious diversity....This refugee flow has outraged the right wing,.. said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. ...If you scratch the surface, why are they so upset? It..È not about jobs or the ability to manage them or social welfare. What it is really about is that they are Muslim...Unlike countries in Western Europe, which have long histories of accepting immigrants from diverse cultures, the former Communist states tend to be highly homogeneous. Poland, for instance, is 98 percent white and 94 percent Catholic....And the countries that have very little diversity are some of the most virulently against refugees,.. said Andrew Stroehlein, European media director for Human Rights Watch.Even mainstream political leaders eager for closer ties to Brussels, the European Union..È headquarters, feel pressure to appeal to this growing nationalist wave....By toughening up their rhetoric and showing a strong hand toward the Roma minority, facing down the E.U. and refusing a common solution to the refugee crisis, they are trying to outbid the far right and keep the traditional political parties in power,.. said Zuzana Kus., a senior research fellow at the Institute for Sociology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.There is also widespread disappointment with the pace of economic change since communism..È fall, and a sense that the countries are too poor to offer substantial support to immigrants....There is a long history of victimization in our region,.. said Csaba Szal._, a professor of sociology at Masaryk University in Brno. ...We are the ones who have always been victims of injustice, the ones who have suffered. And now there is somebody trying to grab that status. People find it very difficult to accept that somebody might suffer more than us...While rising xenophobia is playing a role, there are other factors behind the East-West divide, said Marcin Zaborowski, executive vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis and head of its Warsaw office....The primary reason for this difference in attitude is that we come from a region where the tradition of accepting culturally different refugees is very weak,.. he said. ...And now there is this wave of refugees from another continent that has no precedent, so people don..È know what to think...Most of the countries, like Poland, have ...no proper infrastructure in place to deal with such cultural assimilation.. and little appetite to spend precious resources building one, Mr. Zaborowski said.As for the region..È seeming indifference to the migrants..Èplight, that is partly because unlike France, Britain and Germany, the former Communist states have no history of colonialism, he said....The attitude is: We didn..È meddle in these countries that are now sending the refugees, like other nations did, and so we have no sense of guilt about our obligation to deal with them,.. Mr. Zaborowski said.And all of these attitudes blend together into a common aversion to being told what to do by Brussels.In Hungary, Mr. Orban has taken a particularly uncompromising approach, demanding more help from Brussels in dealing with the tens of thousands who continue to enter his country while insisting that Hungary is under no obligation to endanger its traditional Christian values by accepting large numbers of Muslims.On Tuesday, a new raft of refugee laws go into effect that will allow the Hungarian government to build new ...transit zones.. at the border where arrivals would have their asylum requests quickly reviewed ... eight days, plus three more for an appeal, a pace that refugee advocates believe violates European Union due process rules.But Hungary is not the only country that has taken a hard line or seen anti-immigrant protests.Anti-immigrant marches have become a regular occurrence in Slovakia and some other nations.In Estonia, the northernmost Baltic nation, which has a population of just 1.3 million, an agreement to accept fewer than 200 refugees over the next two years was enough to set off protests. Right-wing bikers demonstrated outside the country..È only refugee relocation facility in July, and earlier this month it was severely damaged in a fire.Officials in Latvia said they would continue to resist mandatory requirements that they accept a set number of refugees while the parties in the ruling coalition appear unable to agree on whether to require a parliamentary vote on the issue....It would be very wrong and sad if this matter threatened the government,.. said President Raimonds Vejonis.Lithuanian officials said they were open to discussing the acceptance of more refugees, but only on a voluntary basis, and would continue to oppose a ...permanent mechanism.. that would allocate future refugees.Bulgaria had agreed to accept 500 refugees, but under a new formula unveiled last week, it could be asked to take up to 2,000.Talking by phone while driving from an economic conference in southern Poland, Robert Biedron, the mayor of the city of Slupsk, said he was ashamed of the reaction of many to the plight of the migrants. ...There is always conflict around the world and people need help,.. Mr. Biedron said. ...Perhaps, someday again, the Polish people might need help. Do we want to hear, ...Oh, Poles are a danger to society, you are different, you are not of our culture...È..Already, he said, he has blocked many former friends on Facebook ... ...even well-educated people, who I thought were my friends.. ... over anti-immigrant comments they have posted....Here I am, driving on a road that was built with European Union money,.. Mr. Biedron said. ...It was built with money taken from taxpayers in Italy and Germany and France. Now we refuse to do our part? I am really ashamed...Mr. Walesa said he intended to do his part. Reacting to a call from Pope Francis that Catholics take in a refugee family, Mr. Walesa said he wanted to do just that, if he can talk his wife into it....She is reluctant,.. he said. ...She had to single-handedly raise our children and she..È exhausted. So I would have to be the one responsible for taking care of the migrants...",24.4,8.39,3.71,4.68,15.09,12.95,5.07,4.36,5.07,2.47,4.49,6.31,0.07,0,0.13,0,3.32,0,0

Parents with two preschool-aged children save an average of $6,970 a year by hiring one. And the savings are greater with more children. Licensed daycare, if you can find it, costs between $1,300 and $2,000 a month for each space, she told the Edmonton Journal.Wages for a nanny can run anywhere between $12 and $20 an hour.Eighty per cent of families with nannies have at least one spouse working at an oilsands plant. ...In other words, the oilsands industry is dependent on the sort of flexibility and consistency provided to its workers by live-in caregivers,.. says Dorow.Temporary foreign workers can also be found at Canadian Tire and Sobeys. Some, such as Luis, 49, drive trucks loaded with water to surrounding work camps. Others help to build the work camps or are employed as cleaners and housekeeping staff in the camps.The Athabasca river flows past the growing suburbs of Fort McMurray, Alta. Temporary foreign workers have helped propel the city's booming economy, but recent rule changes have made it harder for them to stay on a long-term basis.Most of the temporary foreign workers in Fort McMurray are from the Philippines, often sending money to their children and families back home.Jonathan, 34, came to Canada five years ago and became a Canadian citizen in July. The truck driver says he sends 40 per cent of his earnings to the Philippines because his brother needs kidney dialysis.He and 10 guest workers live in a small bungalow near the city centre. They pay rent totalling $5,800 a month.Alma was a cleaner in Fort Mac. Even though she had worked in Canada for four years, she was sent back to the Philippines earlier this year after the federal government revised guest worker rules.Before she left, she and some co-workers filed a complaint with their employer about overtime that was owed. The co-workers were subsequently fired.Last year, the federal government announced changes to make it more difficult for temporary foreign workers to stay here on a long-term basis. Fort McMurray employers were outraged.Wayne Bigelow, vice-president of operations for the three Tim Hortons franchises, told Fort McMurray Today that franchises might have to reduce hours and even close on certain days of the week....I think it will be mayhem in Fort McMurray if the temporary foreign workers have to leave,.. says Jennifer Best, executive director of YMCA community programs.Best estimates there are 3,500 guest workers in Fort McMurray alone staffing fast food chains, hotels and work camps.Not everyone is happy about the presence of so many temporary workers. Earlier this year, the Fort McMurray Airport Authority announced it was planning to lay off permanent, unionized cleaning and security staff in favour of hiring guest workers at lower pay.A telephone poll conducted by Environics on behalf of the Alberta Federation of Labour found 89 per cent of respondents were opposed to the plan. Fifty-four per cent thought the airport CEO should be fired.In the end, the workers were laid off and offered their jobs back at a lower rate. And the new contractor was encouraged to hire Canadians first.Temporary foreign workers may have become a necessity in Fort McMurray, but they are not always popular.",18.79,5.58,2.79,2.79,13.94,10.77,4.82,2.79,4.44,1.14,5.45,6.72,0.25,0,0,0,1.01,0,0
57,0,"The federal government says it now has the power to revoke the citizenship of some Canadians convicted of terrorism, treason or espionage.A controversial new law, first introduced last June, went into effect on Friday.The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration says there are several serious crimes that could result in dual citizens losing their Canadian status.The ministry says it would revoke citizenship for anyone found guilty of terrorism, treason and high treason, and spying for a foreign government.The rules would also apply to dual citizens who take up arms against Canada by fighting in a foreign army or joining an international terrorist organization.The new law has met with strong public criticism, and two Ontario lawyers have already launched a court case arguing it is unconstitutional.Immigration Minister Chris Alexander argued the new rules are meant to confront what he described as the ...ever-evolving threat of jihadi terrorism......Our government knows that there is no higher purpose for any government than to ensure the safety and security of its citizens and we have never been afraid to call jihadi terrorism exactly what it is,.. Alexander said Friday in Toronto.He said the changes to the Citizenship Act will ensure that ...those who wish to do us harm will not be able to exploit their Canadian citizenship to endanger Canadians or our free and democratic way of life...Critics have expressed concerns about the way in which the new law could be applied to certain high-profile cases.When they were first announced, the New Democrats extracted a promise from the government that the new rules would not be used to target Egyptian-Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy, who was then a dual citizen.Fahmy was convicted of supporting a terrorist group in a widely-denounced trial held in Egypt and was originally sentenced to seven years.The Al Jazeera television producer later gave up his Egyptian citizenship in an unsuccessful bid to be deported back to Canada and is currently undergoing a new trial on terrorism charges.In a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair argued that Fahmy..È case highlighted the risks inherent in the new legislation.In October, Toronto-based lawyers Paul Slansky and Rocco Galati launched a constitutional court challenge against the new law.

But Citizenship and Immigration sources told the network that politics were also an influencing factor.CTV reported that PMO staff reviewed the files to ensure the right refugees were accepted, such as those with established communities in Canada, which Conservatives could hopefully attract into their fold.Earlier Thursday, Harper strenuously denied the suggestion that his staff were involved, saying they had no role in approving applications....Political staff are never involved in approving refugee applications. Such decisions are made by officials in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration,.. Harper said at the start of a speech to a Vancouver-area audience.The Globe and Mail also reported that the intake of Syrian refugees was paused as the government did an audit of the initial batch of 1,300 refugees accepted into the country.Only UN-referred refugee files were audited as the government knows less about those cases when they arrive for processing than they do about refugees being brought to Canada by private groups, said a government source speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the system, Canadian Press reported.Harper confirmed his office asked for an audit to confirm the government..È goals were being met....Our government has adopted a generous approach to the admission of refugees while ensuring the selection of the most vulnerable people and keeping our country safe and secure,.. Harper said.Harper said his office asked for an audit to ensure ...these policy objectives are being met.An official told the Star Thursday that the audit was sparked in part by open reports and intelligence reports raised concerns that Islamic State fighters were ...actively.. trying to infiltrate the flood of migrants and make their way to western countries....That is a very real concern,.. said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The audit meant a pause of the intake of government-sponsored refugees for several weeks, but private sponsorships continued uninterrupted, the official said.He said the audit was a ...look at the process, not the worthiness of any particular file...Still, Harper..È political rivals were quick to jump on reports of his alleged involvement, warning that it may have delayed help to desperate refugees....Now, we learn it was Stephen Harper, himself, who prevented the arrival of Syrian families into Canada in the worst Syrian refugee crisis since World War II,.. NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair said during a morning campaign stop in Toronto.Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said the news report was further proof of Harper..È meddling instincts and said it was another reason to toss the Conservatives out of government in the coming election.Loly Rico, president of the Canadian Council of Refugees, said the latest news could explain why Canada has been slow to accept refugees fleeing the civil war-torn country....Now, it..È understandable how low numbers on the resettlement will come in this year, because they delayed the process of selection, and also they..Èe selecting what type of refugees they (want),.. Rico told the Star.Lorne Waldman of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers said the PMO..È alleged intervention strongly suggested that it was the Conservative government..È plan to only take in Christian minorities from war-torn Syria....Canada..È response to the crisis had been pathetic because we..È been preventing people from coming,.. Waldman said.According to Waldman, all refugee applicants have to undergo security checks and some are then referred to an ...enhanced security check,.. if they fall under certain profiles, based on age or personal history.Hanna Al-Khoulani of Mississauga have been waiting for 18 months on her refugee sponsorship for her nephew now stranded in Ivory Coast; she said she was surprised to learn Ottawa had put a hold on the government-assisted refugee program amid the PMO audit....The government has to do what it has to do, but they should have informed the public about it instead of keeping it a secret.

Lockheed said it would continue to supply technical services to military and intelligence customers.The deal for Sikorsky, which makes the popular Black Hawk helicopters and is based in Stratford, Conn., would further bolster Lockheed..È status as the world..È biggest military contractor by adding another major business line to its varied lines of military equipment, including the F-35 fighter jet.The transaction will be structured in a way that generates a tax benefit of about $1.9 billion for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders, effectively reducing the purchase price to $7.1 billion, Lockheed says.The Sikorsky business, which had been part of United Technologies for decades, recorded net sales of $7.5 billion in 2014 and employed more than 15,000 people.Marillyn Hewson, chairwoman, president and chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said in a news release that Sikorsky was ...a natural fit.. for Lockheed Martin, which had worked on helicopter projects with Sikorsky but did not build helicopters on its own. She added that Lockheed..È reconsideration of its technology services businesses stemmed from the ...recent shifts in market dynamics...The Sikorsky deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by late fourth quarter 2015 or early first quarter 2016.The combination of Lockheed and Sikorsky will most likely be scrutinized by the United State Defense Department, which has indicated that it wants to preserve competition among military contractors. Ms. Hewson told analysts on Monday that the company did not expect to run into government opposition since the deal would not reduce the number of companies that make military helicopters.Boeing, Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland, which is headquartered in Italy, also build helicopters for the Pentagon.Lockheed says it expects to add Sikorsky to its Mission Systems and Training business segment after the deal. Sikorsky..È commercial helicopter business has suffered recently, as the drop in oil prices has cut into its business with oil and gas companies.Bruce Tanner, Lockheed..È chief financial officer, told analysts on Monday that he expected Sikorsky..È business to turn around over the next several years.The sale came after a review of strategic alternatives for the 90-year-old Sikorsky business that United Technologies conducted this year.In June, United Technologies said that it was considering selling or spinning off the business this year. That same month, Sikorsky said that it planned to cut up to 1,400 jobs, or about 9 percent of its work force.Divesting itself of Sikorsky would help simplify the business mix of United Technologies, whose products include Otis elevators, Carrier air-conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines.Based in Hartford, United Technologies posted net sales of $65.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.Founded on Long Island in 1925, Sikorsky manufactures and services military and commercial helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. In 1929, it was acquired by the predecessor of United Technologies, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation.In addition to Black Hawks, Sikorsky makes a range of commercial and military helicopters, including the S-76 and the S-92 commercial helicopters and the Seahawk military helicopter. It is also developing the CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter for the Marine Corps and the HH-60W combat rescue helicopter for the Air Force.Last year, Sikorsky won the contract to build the next generation of Marine One helicopters, which are used to transport the president.Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., produces a wide variety of military and aerospace equipment.

Walk around the exhibitors' hall at the conference of the American Correctional Association, held in Indianapolis in early August, and at some point the question will answer itself. Apparently, with enough malign intent and the right tools -  a lighter, for instance -  even disposable plates can be transformed into shivs....This is a piece of Styrofoam, rolled, then heated, then rolled and heated some more,.. said Michael Robertson, salesman for a company called JonesZylon.

You will find these in just about every federal prison, Mr. Robertson said. They can't be rolled and heated into anything harmful, and if inmates throw them at you, they will not inflict much pain....You'd definitely feel it,.. he said....But,.. a colleague said, ...it won't penetrate the skin...Mr. Robertson was one of 264 vendors in booths at the Indiana Convention Center for what is essentially a trade show for the prison industry. It is the shiny, customer-friendly face of a fairly grim business. The A.C.A. accredits jails and prisons and is also the country's largest association for the corrections field, with a membership filled with wardens and state and county correctional administrators.The convention is where those people window-shop. The United States currently imprisons about 2.2 million people, making it the world's largest jailer. Those in charge of this immense population need stuff: food, gas masks, restraints, riot gear, handcuffs, clothing, suicide prevention vests, health care systems, pharmacy systems, commissary services -  the list goes on. These outlays are a small fraction of the roughly $80 billion spent annually on incarceration, though precise sales figures are hard to come by because most companies in this niche market are private. Two publicly traded players, the private prison operators Corrections Corporation of America and the GEO Group, have a combined market capitalization of almost $5.8 billion. Both companies had booths in Indianapolis.Continue reading the main storyPrison ProductsThose in charge of America's incarcerated need stuff: food, gas masks, restraints, riot gear, handcuffs and so on.

Sentencing reform has been gaining momentum as a growing number of diverse voices conclude that the tough-on-crime ethos that was born 40 years ago, and that led to a 700 percent increase in the prison population since 1970, went too far. Mandatory minimum laws, many of them passed at the state and federal level in the '70s, '80s and '90s locked people away for decades, often for relatively minor, nonviolent offenses. Those laws have had a disproportionate impact on African-Americans, who tend to serve longer sentences than whites.For families, the results have been devastating. Former inmates are stigmatized and have a far harder time finding jobs, causing incalculable social and economic damage. And a paucity of rehabilitation programs keeps many former criminals ensnared. Nearly three out of four inmates offend again after five years.The first stirrings of sentencing overhaul happened five years ago, around the time that California's prison system was so bursting with inmates that a federal court called the conditions unconstitutional and mandated reductions. Texas has stepped up its use of community supervision programs and drug courts. For the first time in state history, it has closed prisons -  three of them. The point is to save money, as former Gov. Rick Perry underscored time and again.More recently, for reasons both humanitarian and fiscal, the notion of changing sentencing laws has gone national. At a time when congressional Democrats and Republicans agree on almost nothing, there is a rare political consensus that the criminal justice system needs to try something other than severity. In July, when President Obama called on Congress to pass laws that would slash mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders, the response was essentially ...We're already on it... Bills like the Smarter Sentencing Act have support across the spectrum, from Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois on the left to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on the right.My goal ambling through the oddly colorful bazaar in Indianapolis for three days was to see what effect -  if any -  this much discussed change was having on the hard-nosed bottom line. Was anyone here experiencing a slump, or even bracing for one? Nobody wants businesses to suffer financially, but if you think the current incarceration system is a calamity, there is no way around it: Bad news for these companies is good news for the country. And if change was coming, or had already arrived, these vendors would be among the first to know.I had no idea what I would find. But a few days before the exhibition doors opened, I spoke on the telephone to a skeptic, a guy who just didn't believe that the country was really on the verge of a correctional system makeover....It's hard for me not to be cynical about it,.. said Jack Cowley, a retired warden who lives in Oklahoma. ...Think about the size of our system, all the judges and lawyers, putting their kids through college, people that make leg irons, Tasers. Crime is driving the train. It's like a business that is too big to fail...Prison in Lime and MangoThe A.C.A. bills its conferences as events offering ...multiple ways to network with industry professionals, find a mentor, get a sneak peek at emerging technology and hone your leadership skills... This sounds like any other conference in any other industry, and in many ways it was. Many booths were staffed by average-looking men standing beside strikingly attractive women. There were a lot of polo shirts stitched with company names. Branded tchotchkes, like pens and key chains, were laid out for the taking. A raffle for a Chevy Cruze was held on the final day. A woman fell to her knees in joy when she won.Beyond the familiar conference format, however, things got weirder. Secure, a Mexican company that sells bulletproof glass, showed a video in which the company's president stood behind his product -  while it was repeatedly shot at with a gun. The guy tried to look nonchalant by puffing on a cigarette.PhotoA wheelchair made of molded plastic parts that cannot be fashioned into weapons. Credit Peter Hoffman for The New York TimesThe event was open to the media, though for reasons that were never clear, news photographers were barred from the exhibit hall. While A.C.A. doesn't want the industry shrouded in mystery, it is not eager for a close-up either. This might stem from less-than-flattering attention the conference has received in the past. A documentary called ...Profits of Punishment,.. released in 2001, included a stroll through the A.C.A. exhibitors' hall, where vendors boasted a little too proudly of the effectiveness of their merchandise. One woman talked about the 600 stitches an inmate needed after an encounter with her company's barbed wire. The film captures an industry relishing a boom....The growth in the corrections population here in the United States will probably double in the next 10 years,.. one vendor says on film, clearly pleased. ...They're building just about as fast as they can...In Indianapolis this summer, there were the ingratiating smiles that are always part of sales, but nobody seemed giddy. Concern about sentencing reform was in the air, but more than a few vendors seemed to regard the trend as a business opportunity.Bob Barker started selling supplies to prisons in 1972, which, coincidentally, was the same year that a gentleman with the same name started hosting a certain television game show. Though the two look nothing alike, he has been confused for the more famous Bob Barker for so long he has stopped correcting people....Guy was just over here who said, ...I've followed you since you were on ...Truth or Consequences!' .. Mr. Barker reported with a smile. ...I said, ...I appreciate that.' ..When Mr. Barker founded his company, he met a lot of incredulous wardens....I would go into jails and start talking toothbrushes and deodorant and I'd get, ...What do you think this is, a Holiday Inn?' If somebody didn't bring you underwear or a toothbrush you didn't get it...Then the drug culture grew, and detention professionals realized that to prevent the flow of drugs into prisons, they had to stop visitors from handing anything to inmates. When that happened, they started buying from Mr. Barker, who today sells about 5,000 different items, making him the largest detention supplier in the country. His inventory includes laundry bags, boots, board games and something called the BarkerBunk, described as ...the toughest stackable correctional specific inmate bunk...Mr. Barker would not say much about his company's financial performance in the last two or three years, other than to describe it as ...sort of flat... He seems unbothered by that, noting that the industry provided his family with a good living for 40 years. But his son, Robert Barker, who is the company's president, was standing next to him, and he sounded anything but defeatist....We're looking long term at how we can be part of the solution,.. the younger Mr. Barker said. ...With more re-entry programs out there, we're looking at future supply opportunities...There was a foray into house arrest ankle monitors, but a couple of conglomerates moved into that field and the Bob Barker Company got out. Since then, the company has been pumping 10 percent of company profits into research in a hunt for new ventures. So far, the elder Mr. Barker says he has only a few vague ideas. As he put it, ...We haven't found the silver bullet...PhotoBob Barker is the founder of the Bob Barker Company, which supplies more than 5,000 items to the detention industry, from board games to stackable inmate bunks. Credit Peter Hoffman for The New York TimesLike Bob Barker, many companies are trying to diversify. In 2013, Corrections Corporation of America, the country's largest private prison company, purchased Correctional Alternatives, which specializes in re-entry programs, like work furloughs and home confinement....We have continued to look for opportunities in this service area,.. a spokesman for C.C.A. wrote in an email. ...It aligns with the needs of our government partners, who are increasingly looking to this type of solution...Many at this conference were what could be called platform agnostic, including Norix, which describes itself as the country's largest maker of prison furniture. Its slogan is ...Engineered to endure,.. and to illustrate the point, the company ran a looping video at its booth featuring inventive assaults on its furniture. One snippet featured a vinyl armchair being slowly squashed down to 10 inches high by a pneumatic crusher.When the machine slowly uncrushed the chair, it retook its original shape....Sales to prisons are flat to down,.. said Sandy Heitman, a senior project manager. ...But more people are being put into mental health facilities, and that portion of the business has increased... The same is true, she added, of halfway houses.We sat on some Norix furniture, which was the opposite of the austere, steel slabs you see in prison documentaries. Norix still makes that style of product, but it was highlighting a vinyl collection that comes in lively colors that the company calls lime, mango, orchid and reef. The furniture is intended to be more ...humanizing,.. a word that is prominent on the company's website....This is a more healing environment,.. Ms. Heitman said, gesturing to the products.As she spoke, the video showed a man in a lab coat jackhammering a chair.PhotoRubber bullets, or what the industry calls less lethal 40mm ammunition. Credit Peter Hoffman for The New York TimesWhat Reductions?The A.C.A. was started as the National Prison Association in 1870 by a group of wardens who thought the justice system needed to emphasize reform and rehabilitation. At its opening session, the group's chairman lamented that prisons ...do not work that reformation in the soul of man that will restore him to society regenerated and reformed... By 1971, the group had been renamed and its annual conference was more about tear gas and stun guns than the souls of men, as detailed in Jessica Mitford's book ...Kind and Usual Punishment...Halcyon days lay ahead. There was a succession of tough-on-crime presidents, including Bill Clinton, who signed a bill in 1994, which he recently renounced, that lengthened sentences. The '80s and '90s were good decades for what is ominously referred to as the prison-industrial complex. In 2005, an article in Prison Legal News about an A.C.A. conference described an almost festive atmosphere. At one point, a young woman in a pink top and silk net stockings gave free shoe shines, courtesy of Aramark, the food giant.That scene is hard to imagine now. Many of the attendees were women. And if your idea of a prison official is lifted from pop culture -  say, ...Orange Is the New Black.. or ...The Shawshank Redemption.. -  you would be disappointed. When attendees were not roaming the exhibitors hall, they sat through a variety of earnest workshops with titles like ...College Behind Bars: Too Soft or Very Sensible?.. (very sensible, according to two academics from Boston University). In another, ...Defining Serious Mental Illness in Corrections,.. the audience was split into groups and asked to refine a definition of serious mental illness. My group spent the entire time in a meta-debate about the debate.During the conference, there was a sign-up sheet for tours of local correctional facilities. This initially sounded ridiculous, the ultimate busman's holiday, but the tours were overbooked. I snagged a spot for a visit to the nearby Marion County Jail. It started with a group of about 25 people climbing aboard what felt like a maximum-security minibus. Incongruously, Foreigner's ...Hot Blooded.. was playing over loudspeakers.I asked a prison warden why on earth she wanted to spend her free time in a jail....Best practices,.. she said, brightly. ...See what other places are doing...The only moments of the tour that were not dreary and kind of heartbreaking came when I spotted products from vendors in the exhibition hall. That is Norix! That is JonesZylon! Early on, we were introduced to a staff seamstress mending a suicide prevention vest made by Bob Barker.The Marion County Jail, our guide explained, is at capacity and recently sent some inmates to a nearby site operated by C.C.A., the private incarceration company. This speaks to a big reason that vendors in Indianapolis seem unruffled by talk of prison reform. It hasn't had a big impact, at least not yet, and it doesn't seem that it will in the future.To understand the ...not yet.. part, consider California, site of the country's most ambitious inmate reductions. The court-ordered program to ease cramped, triple-bunk conditions started in October 2011. To date, the system's head count in the 34 facilities covered by the overcrowding litigation has dropped to 111,000, from 144,000.But the numbers aren't quite what they seem. The law passed in 2011 mandated that new offenders sentenced for nonviolent or nonsex crimes would serve their time in county jails. The days when a jail was a just a pretrial holding pen are over, and the population in those cells is starting to bulge. Yes, there has been a net decline in the total population of incarcerated people in the state. Just not at a rate that would alarm anyone selling, say, inmate blankets....These declines are too small,.. said Peter Wagner of the Prison Policy Initiative, which campaigns for prison reform. ...The numbers are trending downward, but slowly and not consistently...Mr. Wagner also doubted that prison reform laws knocking around Congress, as well as many states, would reduce the prison population as much as some people thought, because they are focused on drug and nonviolent offenders. As numbers collected by the Urban Institute demonstrate, half of all inmates in state prisons are violent offenders, and state prisons are home to 86 percent of the nation's inmates.Yet it is hard to find a politician talking about sentencing reform for violent offenders, a subject that is demonstrably and understandably contentious. In Arkansas, the state eased laws for parolees in 2011, trying to cope with budget issues. Two years later, a man with a history of parole violations and aggravated robbery and theft convictions shot and killed an 18-year-old in Little Rock. The state's board of corrections swiftly enacted new and tougher standards....It changed everything,.. said Dina Tyler of Arkansas Community Correction, as she stood outside the exhibition hall. ...They started bringing parolees in by the truckload... This month, state corrections officials reported that 19,055 inmates were under state jurisdiction, the largest number in Arkansas history. The prison population is also rising in dozens of states.PhotoA stainless steel cell-ready plumbing fixture. Credit Peter Hoffman for The New York TimesAgainst this backdrop, the relative serenity of vendors in Indianapolis made sense. Still, if you looked in the right places, the event quietly reflected a change in attitude that should hearten supporters of reform. For years, attendees said, the only people at these conferences talking about rehabilitation or the well-being of inmates were faith-based groups like the Salvation Army. This time, there were workshops on re-entry success stories and alternative sentencing for juveniles, and many others like it.There were also companies in the exhibition room selling products aimed at improving the lives of inmates. One of them, JPay, markets a gadget that looks like a small iPad ready for a riot. It's encased in a plastic shell and can survive a 30-foot drop. It doesn't connect to the Internet, but it does allow monitored access to music and email. The company markets it as an efficient way for inmates to nurture connections with the outside world. Currently, it is in detention facilities in 14 states....It keeps them engaged; it keeps them from fighting,.. said the company's head of marketing, Jade Trombetta. ...If I send an email that says, ...I'm going to shank this guy, he's screwing with me,' Mom writes back: ...Don't.

He added that the company would ...continue to work with the City on Google..È future in Mountain View...The vote was part of a years-long plan for how to redevelop Mountain View..È North Bayshore area, a mass of low-slung office parks that surrounds Google..È headquarters and is separated from Mountain View proper by Highway 101. At issue was how to allot just over 2 million square feet of future office space, as well as how to build more housing ...- particularly affordable housing ...- in a region that badly needs it.Underscoring this, during an earlier portion of the meeting several Mountain View residents, including a Google engineer named Brandon Jones, protested their imminent eviction from a townhouse development that was recently acquired by a developer.Google..È proposal was to tear down parts of its campus and replace it with a series of airy buildings with translucent roofs and modular interiors that could be moved around and reconfigured like Lego bricks. It was designed by a superstar duo of Heatherwick Studio, a London design firm known for works like the fiery caldron at the 2012 Olympics, and Bjarke Ingels, a Danish architect known for his innovative designs.For LinkedIn, it was a David vs. Goliath victory that was the result of several savvy moves and a project that was ambitious but not too ambitious. At the same time, it showed how Google..È size ...- it is the city..È largest taxpayer, largest employer and owns three Empire State buildings worth of Mountain View real estate ...- has become a liability in its hometown.Indeed, one of LinkedIn..È selling points was that it would ...preserve business diversity,.. meaning it would reduce Mountain View..È dependence on Google.LinkedIn currently leases just under 400,000 square feet in North Bayshore, with a lease that runs out in 2023. Hoping to stay in the area, last year it bought a seven-acre parcel with hopes of developing a new mixed-use development in partnership with a local developer who owns the adjacent land.That land ...is the singular place in Mountain View where we could eventually develop and have enough space for our company without being encumbered by expensive leases, with rates being driven by companies larger and growing faster than ours,.. said Jim Morgensen, LinkedIn..È vice president of global workplace services, in his 10-minute presentation to the council.Compared to Google..È clear, space-age headquarters, LinkedIn..È proposal, called the Shoreline Commons, was quite modest. It would be a cluster of offices and retail, including a movie theater and a gym with a pool and a basketball court, along with several bike and pedestrian paths. But modesty was part of the pitch....We are doing this without asking for any variances in heights or density, with a project that can be built now with existing technology and union labor,.. Mr. Morgensen told the council. It was a not-so-veiled reference to Google..È plan, which required height exceptions and engineering technologies that have not yet been developed.LinkedIn also made the savvy move of partnering with an affordable housing developer, which aims to build new housing projects nearby. Google also had plans to develop housing and is still likely play a role in whatever housing plan emerges, as it owns most of the land in North Bayshore.Despite the vote, this may not be the end of Google..È hope to build something new.

It paid out only $57,451 in ...direct cash assistance to leukemia patients.. in that time, the documents said....Nothing is more shameful than pocketing millions of dollars donated by good-hearted people who just wanted to help children afflicted with a terminal illness,.. the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said.Even the foundation..È Make a Dream Come True program for children with cancer was mostly a mirage, according to investigators. The foundation..È website, which appears to have been taken down last year, said the program arranged family trips and introductions to celebrities. A telemarketing script used in fund-raising efforts said the program sent children to places like Disney World.But the court petition said the foundation had spent nothing on the program since March 2009, and only $7,866 in 12 months before that.Investigators said the foundation amounted to a one-man operation doing business from the basement of a home in the Bergen Beach section of Brooklyn.That one man, the petition said, was Zvi Shor, who started the foundation in 1991 after losing a son to leukemia. The court papers said Mr. Shor, who ran a construction and plumbing business, had paid himself $595,000 in salary and $600,000 in deferred compensation from 2009 to 2013, along with the promise of a lifetime pension of more than $100,000 a year.The petition illustrated some of the difficulties of regulating nonprofit organizations, a responsibility that falls to the attorney general..È charities bureau.

Mr. Shor remained so much in charge, the court papers said, that Mr. Gutwein did not know who the foundation..È directors were. When lawyers from the charities bureau handed him a list of the directors, he said he had ...no idea who these people are...Mr. Gutwein, reached for comment on Monday, said his lawyer would be in touch.The petition said Mr. Shor admitted to investigators that the foundation never had a registry for bone marrow donors. The court papers said the foundation..È activities about bone marrow work ...were limited to him encouraging callers to become donors, and referring people to their local blood bank...Mr. Shor also claimed the foundation was ...banking stem cells.. in liquid nitrogen at extremely cold temperatures, the petition said. But he told investigators that the foundation had never collected or stored what is known as cord blood.The petition said that when Mr. Gutwein became president, Shlomo Donn, who had spent his entire career working for Mr. Gutwein, became the foundation..È accountant. The court papers said that Mr. Donn repeatedly signed financial forms that must be filed with the attorney general..È charities bureau every year, but did no audits.A call seeking comment on Monday was answered by Mr. Donn..È wife, who said he was not at home and could not be reached.The petition said the foundation had transferred $655,000 to an Israeli organization that Mr. Shor set up, supposedly for research. Some of the money went to one medical researcher there, the petition said, but the foundation did not provide records showing how much.In 2012, Mr. Shor and his wife at the time, Susan Gardin, who also worked for the foundation, delivered a PowerPoint presentation in London that showed a building in Israel labeled ...Biomedical Cancer Research Center... But Mr. Shor later told investigators the lettering had been superimposed on the photograph. Ms. Gardin was quoted in the petition as saying that the Israeli organization had bought part of one floor in the building, not the entire building.The petition also said the foundation had paid for more than $30,000 in personal expenses for Mr. Shor, including $16,615 for gasoline and tolls and $9,000 for supplies used to renovate his house",23.24,6.12,1.81,4.3,12.68,13.82,4.08,2.38,3.06,0.79,6.68,6.68,0,0,0,0,2.04,0,0

68,0,"Selling Hydro One is no ordinary sales job for Kathleen Wynne.For a premier who places a premium on conversations, consultations and consensus, the proposed sale is a done deal. Wynne is pushing her privatization plan through the Legislature with minimal discussion, leaving key questions unanswered.Amid the Hydro One hyperbole and hypocrisy -  the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives keep reversing stances -  here's the good, the bad, the ugly, and the reality on electricity.The Liberals are using their majority to rush the sale without providing the fine print on secret deals with the unions, or protection of the public interest.A government-appointed panel on privatization, headed by ex-TD Bank chief executive Ed Clark, concluded last November that ...Hydro One transmission should remain in public ownership as a core asset... Last month, Clark's panel executed a spectacular backflip, recommending the sale of 60 per cent of Hydro One because, when it came to ...public ownership, we did not find the case compelling...Clark and Wynne insist they have learned lessons from the 1999 fire sale of Hwy. 407, when a PC government undervalued the asset, overpaid for transaction fees, and allowed the private owners to jack up tolls at will. The government promises to retain substantial control of Hydro One, keep transaction costs low, and act transparently.Transparently? As my Star colleague Robert Benzie first reported last month, the government is quietly buying off the influential Power Workers' Union with a sweetheart deal to win their support by giving its members shares in the new entity. The Liberals have refused to provide details on their secret undertakings to the powerful union, which has since dropped its opposition to any privatization.Even with minority ownership of 40 per cent, the government stresses it would be the largest single shareholder of Hydro One, with other owners limited to 10 per cent stakes; key decisions will require a two-thirds vote by the board, giving the province an effective veto; and the government retains the right to fire the entire board (more of a nuclear option than actual control).That's fine as far as it goes. It just doesn't go far enough.Oh, and don't be misled by opposition politicians and major unions that have lapsed into scaremongering about price gouging. By obsessing over price points, these critics are missing the larger point that electricity costs are strictly controlled under law -  the Ontario Energy Board sets rates, not Hydro One, and it has a record of refusing increases.The false spectre of high electricity rates generates more heat than light. The more vexing question is how private profit will prevail over public purpose.As sole owner today, the government operates Hydro One in the public interest -  and pockets roughly $800 million a year in profit. By contrast, the board of the partially privatized entity will have a fiduciary obligation to seek the highest profits for its new shareholders.What difference does that make? In recent years, the Liberals have ordered Hydro One to install expensive smart meters in all Ontario homes, and asked the utility to speed up transmission links to wind turbines or solar panels.Both were examples of elected governments imposing legitimate public policy obligations on Hydro One. Both decisions resulted in higher rates, which is why critics of privatization downplay the issue of public policy (or contradict themselves by pretending that it's all about price).Would a privatized Hydro One make future investments in transmission links to Hydro Quebec should it be in the public interest? The government insists it will find a way, it just won't tell us precisely how.In a speech last week, Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli talked about future legislation that would ...enshrine the government's right to prioritize critical transmission infrastructure... Cabinet could ...designate key transmission corridors.. for First Nations, the Ring of Fire, or electricity trade with Quebec.Details to come. Yet the privatization proceeds apace.Wynne and Clark argue they need the money from privatization to invest in other public assets, notably transit and transportation infrastructure. Facing stiff public opposition to road tolls and other tax hikes, the government opted for an asset swap -  with the result that Hydro One is being cannibalized to put flesh on the bare bones of transit infrastructure.The early criticism of Wynne was that she couldn't make tough decisions. Politics is the art of the possible -  and choosing the least bad option. Now, she has gone against her own ideological instincts to privatize a public asset.What are we giving up in control of transmission lines to gain new transit lines? The potential risk would be worth taking only if Wynne had exhausted all other options. But she hasn't.To govern is to choose, and privatizing is nothing if not a bold choice. Just not bold enough.Rather than an asset swap that shortchanges the public interest, Wynne should have fought harder to bolster transit revenues to meet her cash shortfall. True, the PCs and NDP teamed up during the minority government years to oppose taxes and tolls, but she now has a majority.She is using that majority to impose privatization of Hydro One on us rather than introduce new revenue measures, because our electricity utility offers the path of least resistance. While privatization is unpopular, taxation is even more unpopular.Clark and Wynne argue that failing to make critical infrastructure investments in transit would be a missed economic opportunity. They are right about the opportunity costs, but wrong about the political opportunism that underlies their calculations.",19.19,6.19,2.39,3.8,13.36,10.31,4.56,2.39,5.1,2.06,4.78,4.99,0,0.22,0.43,0,0.87,0,0

It was heralded as the first concrete step taken by the United States and China on the thorny issue of online espionage.With President Xi Jinping of China beside him at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden last month, President Obama said the two had come to an agreement that China and the United States would refrain from attacks aimed at pilfering company intellectual property or trade secrets for commercial advantage.Less than a day after that announcement and after Mr. Xi had met in Seattle with the executives of leading American technology companies, a hacking group accused of having links to the Chinese government attacked one such company, looking for trade secrets.In a blog post on Monday, the security services provider CrowdStrike, based in Irvine, Calif., said that it had tracked a number of attacks on American tech and pharmaceutical companies leading up to and after Mr. Xi..È visit to the United States last month. (Mr. Xi has been logging airtime, making his first state visit to Britain this week.)...We detected and stopped the actors, so no exfiltration of customer data actually took place,.. according to the post, written by the CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer, Dmitri Alperovitch.But more problematic, he wrote in the post, was that the attacks had continued in the three weeks since Washington and Beijing signed the security agreement.The news of further hacking attempts is likely to put new pressure on the countries..Èagreement to limit attacks on private companies. A number of analysts had already expressed skepticism that the accord would lead to concrete changes in a Chinese policy they say has sought for years to plunder secrets from companies in the United States.In announcing the agreement, Mr. Obama said the United States would be ...watching carefully.. to see if the accord led to progress, and he did not rule out economic sanctions against Chinese companies if the attacks continued.Of those attacked, ...seven of the companies are firms in the technology or pharmaceuticals sectors, where the primary benefit of the intrusions seems clearly aligned to facilitate theft of intellectual property and trade secrets,.. Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the blog post....The intrusion attempts are continuing to this day, with many of the China-affiliated actors persistently attempting to regain access to victim networks even in the face of repeated failures,.. he added.According to the CrowdStrike blog post, several of the recent attacks were the responsibility of a group it calls Deep Panda, which the company said it had tracked for many years. Deep Panda often goes after strategic national security targets, but it has also hacked companies in an array of industries, including in agriculture, finance, chemicals and technology.Mr. Alperovitch did not write that the continued hackings were evidence that the deal had failed, though he called for the Obama administration to explain what it expected the agreement to accomplish....The fact that there is some time delay between agreement and execution is not entirely unexpected,.. Mr. Alperovitch wrote. ...But we need to know the parameters for success, and whether the parties to the agreement discussed a time frame for implementation, or, instead, expected it to be immediate...In one of the first major markers of Chinese action against the attacks, the country arrested a number of hackers who were said to have stolen secrets of United States companies before Mr. Xi..È American visit, according to The Washington Post.Even so, further attacks were likely to be viewed as a setback. Though China is home to a hard-to-control and diffuse network of state-affiliated hackers, it would probably be fairly simple for Beijing to control a central group like Deep Panda.",31.2,4.97,1.44,3.53,16.67,10.74,4.81,2.56,3.53,2.4,4.65,5.93,0,0,0,0,1.92,1,0
75,0,"Dollars follow eyeballs. This bedrock principle of media advertising is working against the television industry today, as new viewing patterns challenge old ways of doing business.The most recent evidence surfaced in August, when one major media company after another reported weaker television advertising revenue. The shares of the companies, including Disney, 21st Century Fox, Viacom and CBS, suffered as Wall Street saw a warning sign that Madison Avenue has recognized for some time....The traditional TV model is breaking apart,.. said Laura Desmond, chief executive of Starcom MediaVest, one of the world..È largest ad-buying companies. ...It..È both a crisis and a huge opportunity...The peril and promise are byproducts of television..È truly becoming a digital medium. Internet services like Netflix and YouTube deliver video programming to screens large and small, in living rooms and on smartphones ... and it is sent ...over the top,.. in industry jargon, via the Internet, sidestepping the TV industry..È accustomed control point, the set-top box. In addition, digital recording services, now offered by cable and satellite TV operators, allow programs to be recorded for later viewing.The TV market is fracturing and becoming less predictable, undermining the main appeal of traditional TV to advertisers: its ability to deliver mass-market audiences.Yet as TV embraces digital technology, it opens the door to targeting television ads as never before, much as is done with advertising on the web today.That helps explain the surge in digital video advertising on Google..È YouTube, Facebook and streaming services like Hulu, where the rules of Internet targeting apply. Those online video ads are only a tenth of the television ad market of $70 billion a year, but they are projected to grow 21 percent a year, according to Forrester Research. By contrast, advertising on cable and broadcast television is expected to inch ahead at 1 percent annually.Until recently, TV audience information used by advertisers has come mainly from samples of viewers and surveys, conducted by Nielsen and other market research companies. The monitoring made possible by digital technology can be far more detailed ... down to the household level ... not only covering what is being watched but, when combined with other data sources, also predicting behavior and buying habits. ...The Internet was an example of what can be done, but now it is going to TV as well,.. said Shereta Williams, president of Videa, an advertising technology start-up owned by the Cox Media Group.The technology for digital TV is still in its early stages. The TV industry wants to be able to target ads to households and individuals, as on the web, but without losing control of its distribution network and business.The set-top box has long been TV..È technical gateway, and that technology is receiving a digital upgrade to give set-top boxes Internet-style targeting capabilities. Today, including satellite TV and cable providers, nearly 40 million set-top boxes are ...household addressable,.. representing about a third of American households.For advertisers, this should mean more productive ads and the ability to scientifically test their effectiveness. Last year, Starcom MediaVest did an addressable TV ad campaign for Honda..È Acura TLX luxury sedan. The firm combined anonymized sales data and other data to choose 1.7 million households to show Acura ads. Those households..Èrate of buying the cars was more than 60 percent higher than that of a demographically similar control group who were not shown the ads.With advanced software and data-mining technology, the potential for tailoring ads can be quite refined. So, for example, two households in New York, living in next-door apartments, could watch, say, ...The Good Wife,.. and see different ads. In one apartment, a couple who contribute to environmental causes and have no children could be shown an ad for a compact car. In the other apartment, a couple with two children and a weekend home might be shown an ad for a sport utility vehicle.The future of TV advertising may be more like web advertising, but it will not be a rerun, analysts and industry executives insist. On the web, some newspaper and magazine publishers have built sizable digital ad businesses. But it has proved to be a winner-take-most marketplace, with the biggest winners being the Internet ad giants Google and Facebook....TV will take on some of the characteristics of Internet advertising in terms of targeting and relying on data to predict who is behind the screen,.. said James Nail, an analyst at Forrester Research. ...But video sellers have greater power to dictate how the new technology rolls out...On traditional television, major consumer product and brand advertisers want their ads to be shown alongside high-quality video programming, mainly the sitcoms and dramas the medium is known for, say the analysts and executives. It is the kind of video environment, they say, that delivers the sight, sound and emotion that drive decision-making....Premium content is scarce, and scarcity creates a huge difference between TV and the Internet,.. said Scott Ferber, chief executive of Videology, an ad tech start-up.The big media companies have used that scarcity to deflect competition in the past. In 2012, Google shut down its Google TV Ads unit after it made little headway in trying to adapt its Internet marketplace model to selling television ads. The TV networks and local stations, analysts say, refused to put the ad inventory they hold for marketers on the Google marketplace.Today, Google is pursuing a vision of Internet-style ad delivery ... called programmatic TV ... but with a modified approach, portraying itself as a tools maker to assist content providers and marketers.Google..È role, said Rany Ng, director of product management for video ads, is to ...bring data-driven buying and automation to how television and video advertising is bought...In recent years, video ad tech start-ups have proliferated, typically specializing in working with the big media companies or ad buyers. They provide software expertise and consulting services and often match buyers and sellers....This is so central to the creators..Èand marketers..Èstrategy. They are going to want to be in greater control over time,.. said Bill Day, chief executive of Tremor Video, an ad technology start-up.For finely tailored ads, data is crucial. So data brokers and data-analysis companies, including Acxiom, Experian and Dunnhumby, are also suppliers to the emerging industry of digital TV.Acxiom, for example, has demographic, shopping and lifestyle information on every American household. Rick Erwin, its general manager of audience solutions, views digital TV as another market for its targeting services, which are used in direct mail, telemarketing, email and online ads....Whenever a medium becomes addressable at the household level, we..Èe the data fuel,.. he said.For advertisers, the long-term goal is to be able to reach ideal customers for their products, on any screen. The potential, said Mr. Nail of Forrester, is for a TV viewing experience less cluttered with irrelevant ads and ...dramatically improved results for TV advertisers...But predicting the winners in the high-stakes, high-tech migration to digital TV, analysts and executives agree, is uncertain. Ms. Desmond of Starcom MediaVest, for example, expects a wrenching consolidation in the media business over the next three years or so. The only three sure survivors, she said, are Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast NBCUniversal. Smaller players will most likely be bought up.The acquirers, Ms. Desmond said, may well include the Internet powerhouses, like Google and Facebook.Even those who insist the TV market is unique have their qualms. ...It should be different,.. Mr. Ferber of Videology said, ...but these digital companies are so huge and so powerful, they are going to be hard to resist...",21.78,4.44,1.01,3.42,13.54,11.13,6.69,2.33,5.84,0.39,4.98,8.72,0.08,0,0,0,2.33,1,1

I have crazy visions of what we..Èl be doing in the future. But it..È not going to reach hundreds of millions of people in the next three years,"" Palmer Luckey told Recode.Luckey is the co-founder of Oculus VR, the Facebook-owned company that is largely responsible for kicking off the current wave of interest in VR. Just before E3 last week, Oculus held its own press event where it showed off the commercial version of its VR device, the Rift, and unveiled new hand-held controllers that help people interact in virtual space.As with any new technology, cost of VR gear is likely to be high initially. While Oculus didn't announce a price, it did release the PC specifications needed to run its headset, estimating that the cost of a computer and a Rift headset might be in the $1,500 range. Sony said its Project Morpheus headset will costs several hundred dollars, and obviously will require a PS4 to work with, which retails for $449 in Canada.Part of the issue that remains is that extended periods with a poorly calibrated VR set can cause nausea. The immersive nature of VR tricks the brain into seeing a world that doesn..È match what all the user..È senses are registering. That disconnect is what causes nausea.Many companies are planning on launching virtual reality headsets in the coming year, but there are still a number of issues that VR has to solve before it can really go mainstream. ALLEN J. SCHABEN / TNS FILE PHOTOMany companies are planning on launching virtual reality headsets in the coming year, but there are still a number of issues that VR has to solve before it can really go mainstream.Hard-core gaming is clearly how VR will make its first real inroads with consumers. But even there, many are taking a wait-and-see approach. Microsoft..È VR Hololens was one of the buzziest E3 onstage demonstrations, but when reviewers actually got to try it out, many were disappointed. It..È a wrap around headset, but the actual field-of-view that the device provides is quite small, which many complained ruined the immersive feel of device ... and immersive feel is what VR is supposed to be all about.The other big issue is that virtual reality needs to settle before it goes mainstream is settling on a single format. Beyond the video game companies, phone companies such as Samsung and HTC are also creating headsets, meaning choice for consumers, but a potential stumbling block for content creators.""We haven't seen the commercial release of the hardware. We haven't seen commercial release of any software,.. told BloombergStrauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two, makers of Grand Theft Auto told Bloomberg. ""We're intrigued. We're doing a lot of homework. We haven't made any announcements yet. I think it remains to be seen what that format is.""While gaming companies are experimenting with different experience and extended tech demos, virtual reality will require a new way of game making and figuring out what might work.Nintendo has yet to announce a VR headset, and one of the company's executives pointed to the fact that it is an isolating experience as being a drawback.""We have knowledge of the technical space, and we've been experimenting with this for a long, long time,"" said Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime in a Polygon interview.

The company will also work toward making it easier for elderly drivers to hang onto their keys in aging countries including Japan and the U.S., Toyota's biggest markets.Getting an edge in this research would set Toyota apart from its Japanese peers, which have been pursuing fully autonomous cars under more conservative time frames than Google Inc. or Tesla Motors Inc. With Toyota President and racing enthusiast Akio Toyoda by his side, the newly-formed R&D unit's chief executive said competing to put autonomous cars on the road will be an endurance contest, rather than a sprint....It's possible at the beginning of a car race that you may not be in the best position,.. said Gill Pratt, CEO of the institute and Toyota's executive technical adviser. ...It may be that other drivers are saying a whole lot about what their position is, and everyone may expect that a particular car will win.

The Toronto-based start-up had a Super Bowl commercial in Canada that is still airing, introducing people to its new social platform.So what the heck is a Hubub? With the tag line, ...Your Interest Internet,.. it is a topic-based site that wants to become a place where users discuss things online. People sign on and create or follow Hububs for all kinds of interests, from Sports Brawls to Human Rights in Korea. What makes this site different is beyond comments, there..È a rich media experience: users can post images, blogs, articles and polls, and pose questions for debate....It is bit like Facebook..È newsfeed without all the other crap around,.. says Robert Oh, Hubub..È product lead.Or another take: ...It..È sort of like a chat room on steroids, but much more.. says founder Peter Corsell.That TV commercial came partly thanks to a $5 million equity stake from Bell Media, which also has marketing and monetization rights to Hubub in Canada and hopes that its investment will grow exponentially if the 46-person company becomes the next big online thing.The site aims to increase user engagement, and there may be an opportunity, as online commenting and chat rooms haven..È evolved much, even though they are clearly used. The problem: they..Èe not areas where people have figured out how to make money. For most media companies, commenting is a troublesome must have.That..È where Hubub sees an opportunity. While the company has created it..È own site housing topic pages, Hububs can also be placed on other sites. Thanks to Bell, users will start seeing more of these, starting on Monday with TSN..È NHL trade deadline coverage. This is a high-traffic date for the network..È TradeCentre; instead of the regular comments section at the bottom of the page, users will find a Hubub....Because we have a large marketing machine ... a megaphone, we like to call it ... we can invest in smaller guys, and help them along,.. says Jeff Hersh, director of strategy and business development at Bell Media. Hubub ...is a very interesting opportunity, as it plays in the social and search areas....Do we know it..È going to be a sure success? No, but all the big online players are international, so you do have start at an earlier stage in Canada if you want to get in on these opportunities...Something like Hubub needs highly engaged users to exist; in particular, it needs people who want to curate content into Hububs, as well as those who want to read them.Chantal Bechervaise saw a commercial and decided to check it out.

When you create a page, it is a bit like Pinterest. When you pin something, it stays there...With 17,000 views on Hubub, Becervaise says she likes how it has driven traffic to her blog.Hubub is still working on its technology, building up topic pages and finding ways to work with Bell properties. But the path to monetization comes from eventually providing advertising opportunities. The company wants to work with brands to create content they would share on pages. Similar to Buzzfeed, it..È a native advertising play ... ads that look like content ... that curators can decide to post.For example, if a user created a home renovation Hubub that garnered a large following, Hubub could convince a hardware store to make a how-to video, which it would offer to the Hubub owner to post.Other users can create rival Hububs in the same topic area, effectively competing for readers and monetization opportunities. It is an idea similar to Foursquare, where users can usurp others by checking in at certain places more often.That requires a high level of sophistication from both brands and users, not to mention content good enough to pull people away from more established discussion zones, such as Reddit....Brands are already realizing they have to get better as creating that kind of content,.. says Corsell. ...The great part of this is that content will be in a place people are looking for it...Right now, Hubub is in the user acquisition phase, and there is no mention of longer-term plans for monetization on the site.

And a smartphone that rotates like a cat mid-air to avoid landing on its pretty glass face.You may not see them on shelves anytime soon, but they are among the inventions that Apple protected in 2014 as it took in a bumper crop of new patents.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple 2,003 utility patents, which recognize new and useful processes and machines. That..È a 13 per cent increase over 2013 and more than triple the company..È 2010 haul, according to IFI Claims, a patent analysis firm.The steady increase in patents comes as Apple is doubling down on research and development, pouring $6 billion into its labs in fiscal year 2014, which ended in September.

Among other areas, the company has amassed more intellectual property related to television, a household staple ripe for reinvention, and cybersecurity, one of the tech industry..È greatest headaches after a series of worrisome hacks.The tech titan..È burgeoning patent portfolio mirrors a shift underway in Silicon Valley and across the globe as companies worldwide are racing to protect nearly everything their engineers come up with, said Larry Cady, vice president of product marketing at IFI Claims.Grants climbed more than 8 per cent to cross the 300,000 threshold for the first time in 2014, with many companies besting their records.Apple ranked 11th on IFI..È list of top patent recipients and, in the Bay Area of California, second only to Google, which took eighth place with 2,566 patents in 2014, up nearly 39 per cent from the previous year.IBM brought home the most patents, as it has for 22 years running, and valley stalwarts such as Hewlett-Packard and Cisco also showed solid gains, upping their tallies by 16 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively.A patent gives a company the right to use an invention exclusively for a limited period of time. But the trade-off is that the firm must offer up a glimpse of what it is working on, which is notoriously hard to come by at Apple headquarters.A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the company..È patents.According to data supplied by IFI, the types of technology for which Apple won the most patents in 2014 were computer graphics, mobile communications and computer software. That suggests the company is continuing to focus on its strengths, such as the powerhouse iPhone, which drives more than half its sales.But the company also has steadily earned more patents related to television, bringing home 73 in 2014, up from 28 in 2012 and a mere eight in 2011, according to IFI. That may be good news for Apple fans and investors who have long been waiting for the company to reimagine the television set.One patent granted in December describes technology that would stream content simultaneously on a fixed device such as an Apple TV and a portable gadget such as a smartphone, letting users leave their living rooms to grab snacks without missing a moment of their favourite shows. Another patent describes a new-age wand that users would wave to pick shows, rather than clicking old-fashioned remotes.The company..È patent portfolio also suggests a growing interest in security, with grants related to information security climbing 44 per cent to 39 patents and grants related to cryptography climbing 25 per cent to 15 patents, according to IFI. The company must keep security top of mind as it designs its gadgets, Baker noted....It..È an important consideration in mobile devices because we..Èe living in a world where there are more and more threats in terms of malware, cyberespionage, identity theft and hacks,.. he said.When it comes to Apple, the faintest possibility of a new device is enough to cause investors to sit up and take notice. Patently Apple, a blog that tracks patent filings from Apple, recently spotted that the company had earned a patent for a wearable video camera that sounded a lot like GoPro..È specialty. The action-camera maker..È stock sank about 12 per cent on the news.Regardless of what Apple has cooking in its tightly veiled labs, experts say it is encouraging to see patent grants and R&D spending on the rise....I take it as a strong indication that innovation is alive and well at the company,.. said Stephen Haber, a senior fellow at Stanford University and the Hoover Institution.",25.79,7.4,2,5.41,15.98,10.11,5.52,2.7,4.7,0.35,4.11,6.23,0,0,0,0,0.71,1,0

If there is life in its ocean, alien microbes could be riding those geysers out into space where a passing spacecraft could grab them. No need to drill through miles of ice or dig up rocks.As Chris McKay, an astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Center, said, it's as if nature had hung up a sign at Enceladus saying ...Free Samples...Out ThereA collection of ...Out There.. columns published in The New York Times.The Flip Side of Optimism About Life on Other Planets AUG 3A Window Into Pluto, and Hopes of Opening Other Doors JUL 15The Telescope of the 2030s JUL 13Reaching Pluto, and the End of an Era of Planetary Exploration JUL 6Black Hole Hunters JUN 8See More ÎDiscovering life was not on the agenda when Cassini was designed and launched two decades ago. Its instruments can't capture microbes or detect life, but in a couple of dozen passes through the plumes of Enceladus, it has detected various molecules associated with life: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, molecular nitrogen, propane, acetylene, formaldehyde and traces of ammonia.Wednesday's dive was the deepest Cassini will make through the plumes, only 30 miles above the icy surface. Scientists are especially interested in measuring the amount of hydrogen gas in the plume, which would tell them how much energy and heat are being generated by chemical reactions in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the moon's ocean.It is in such ocean vents that some of the most primordial-looking life-forms have been found on our own planet. What the Cassini scientists find out could help set the stage for a return mission with a spacecraft designed to detect or even bring back samples of life.PhotoSaturn's rings and its moon Enceladus. A NASA spacecraft plunged Wednesday through an icy spray erupting from the satellite. Credit NASA/JPL/Space Science InstituteThese are optimistic, almost sci-fi times. The fact that life was present on Earth as early as 4.1 billion years ago -  pretty much as soon as asteroids and leftover planet junk stopped bombarding the new Earth and let it cool down -  has led astrobiologists to conclude that, given the right conditions, life will take hold quickly. Not just in our solar system, but in some of the thousands of planetary systems that Kepler and other missions squinting at distant stars have uncovered.And if water is indeed the key, the solar system has had several chances to get lucky. Besides Enceladus, there is an ocean underneath the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa, and the Hubble Space Telescope has hinted that it too is venting into space. NASA has begun planning for a mission next decade to fly by it.And of course there's Mars, with its dead oceans and intriguing streaks of damp sand, springboard of a thousand sci-fi invasions of Earth, but in recent decades the target of robot invasions going the other direction.Some scientists even make the case that genesis happened not on Earth but on Mars. Our biochemical ancestors would then have made the passage on an asteroid, making us all Martians and perhaps explaining our curious attraction to the Red Planet.And then there is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, the only moon in the solar system with a thick atmosphere and lakes on its surface, except that in this case the liquid in them is methane and the beaches and valleys are made of hydrocarbon slush.NASA's working definition of life, coined by a group of biologists in 1992, is ...a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution...Any liquid could serve as the medium of this thing, process, whatever it is. Life on Titan would expand our notions of what is biochemically possible out there in the rest of the universe.Our history of exploration suggests that surprise is the nature of the game. That was the lesson of the Voyager missions: Every world or moon encountered on that twin-spacecraft odyssey was different, an example of the laws of physics sculpted by time and circumstance into unique and weird forms.And so far that is the lesson of the new astronomy of exoplanets -  thousands of planetary systems, but not a single one that looks like our own.The detection of a single piece of pond slime, one alien microbe, on some other world would rank as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science. Why should we expect it to look anything like what we already know?That microbe won't come any cheaper than the Higgs boson, the keystone of modern particle physics, which cost more than $10 billion to hunt down over half a century.Finding that microbe will involve launching big, complicated chunks of hardware to various corners of the solar system, and that means work for engineers, scientists, accountants, welders, machinists, electricians, programmers and practitioners of other crafts yet to be invented -  astro-robot-paleontologists, say.However many billions of dollars it takes to knock on doors and find out if anybody is at home, it will all be spent here on Earth, on people and things we all say we want: innovation, education, science, technology.We've seen this have a happy ending before.

Until recently, archaeologists studying these questions were limited mostly to digging up skeletons and artifacts.But now scientists have begun extracting DNA from human bones, and the findings are providing new glimpses at the history of the first Americans. On Monday, researchers at the University of Alaska and elsewhere published an important addition to the growing genetic archive.In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers reported that they had recovered DNA from two skeletons of children who lived in Alaska 11,500 years ago.

After the baby and the fetus died, their bodies were carefully laid atop a bed of red ocher, surrounded by antlers fashioned into hunting darts....These things we hardly ever find ... it..È a very rare window into the worldview of these people,.. said Ben A.

But why the two bodies ended up in the same grave is impossible to know. With the consent of Native American tribes that live around the site, Dr. Potter and his colleagues drilled small pieces of bone from the two skeletons and sent them to geneticists at the University of Utah.The vast majority of our DNA lies in the nucleus of the cell. But the cell..È energy factories, called mitochondria, also carry small bits of their own DNA inherited solely from our mothers.Because each cell can contain hundreds of mitochondria, it is easier to reconstruct their DNA than that of the cellular nuclei. The Utah geneticists focused their search on mitochondrial DNA in the Upward Sun River bones.They succeeded in recovering mitochondrial DNA from both bone samples. But to their surprise, the genes were markedly different. The infant and the fetus did not share the same mother or even maternal grandmother.The researchers can only speculate how an infant and a fetus from different mothers ended up in the same grave. They might have had the same father, or they might have belonged to different families who suffered terrible losses at the same time.But the significance of the DNA found at Upward Sun River extends far beyond the story of two children. It sheds light on how people first moved into the Americas.In 2007, Ripan Malhi of the University of Illinois and his colleagues proposed a model for this migration, known as the Beringian Standstill. Early Siberians expanded east into Beringia about 25,000 years ago, they proposed, and stayed there for about 10,000 years.Humans were able to thrive in Beringia because even at the height of the last ice age, the region was not covered by glaciers. It was mainly tundra and shrub land, with scattered stands of trees.Humans could not expand eastward into the rest of the Americas because they were blocked by glaciers. About 15,000 years ago, as the glaciers retreated, the standstill came to an end....It opened up new ecological zones that were being colonized by plants and animals,.. said Dennis O..Èourke of the University of Utah, a co-author of the new study.According to the standstill hypothesis, the ancestors of Native Americans would have built up a large degree of genetic diversity in the thousands of years they were confined to Beringia ... more so than if these populations had migrated directly from Siberia to the Americas.The fact that two children who died at roughly the same time in the same community shared so few genes is consistent with the idea that the population was prevented from moving into the Americas for thousands of years, Dr. O..Èourke said.But the two children died after the glaciers melted, he noted, and their settlement ...may well be a remnant of that original Beringian group. It may give us a snapshot of that earlier time...Dr. Malhi, who was not involved in the new study, thought the new DNA was too recent to provide proof of the idea that humans were trapped in Beringia for thousands of years. ...It..È valuable information, but it..È a little bit late to be extremely informative to let us know if the Beringian Standstill hypothesis holds,.. he said.More conclusive findings would be possible if scientists found older DNA from people who lived during the Beringian Standstill. Archaeologists are now looking for skeletons from that age, but Dr. Malhi is not holding his breath.Many of the sites where people lived may now be impossible to reach, because sea levels rose at the end of the ice age...There are archaeologists up there looking for such sites,.. Dr. Malhi said. ...But I think it..È probably unlikely, largely because a lot of Beringia is now under water...",21.21,6.06,2.53,3.54,15.4,9.93,4.29,3.62,5.72,0.51,5.39,5.39,0.17,0.08,0,0,1.09,0,0

The dogs were males and females, spayed, neutered and intact. The breeds included Golden retrievers, standard poodles, miniature Dachshunds, miniature Schnauzers, a Jack Russell Terrier, and two mixed breed. They also measured oxytocin in five wolves and their owners.The changes in oxytocin were most pronounced in dogs who fixed longer gazes on their owners, which researchers defined as 100 seconds in the first five minutes of the encounter. They saw no significant difference in oxytocin levels among the breeds or sex of the dogs.In the second experiment, researchers administered nasal sprays of either saline or oxytocin to dogs. This time, each dog entered a room with three humans: its owner and two strangers. But now, only the female dogs who were given the oxytocin displayed an even longer gaze at their owners, who in turn had spikes in their oxytocin levels. Researchers could not say why the sex of the dog mattered. But they speculated that vigilance in male dogs, set off by the presence of the two strangers, may have moderated the effects of oxytocin.Other experts on canine behavior expressed caution about overstating the implications of this study.Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, called the study ...a fascinating direction of research, because it looks at connections between behavioral measures and hormonal components... She noted that it raised many intriguing questions: about long and short gazes; why only female dogs reacted to the oxytocin dose; whether other breeds would yield different results.

85,0,"Acting on a tip from spelunkers two years ago, scientists in South Africa discovered what the cavers had only dimly glimpsed through a crack in a limestone wall deep in the Rising Star Cave: lots and lots of old bones.The remains covered the earthen floor beyond the narrow opening. This was, the scientists concluded, a large, dark chamber for the dead of a previously unidentified species of the early human lineage ... Homo naledi.The new hominin species was announced on Thursday by an international team of more than 60 scientists led by Lee R. Berger, an American paleoanthropologist who is a professor of human evolution studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The species name, H. naledi, refers to the cave where the bones lay undisturbed for so long; ...naledi.. means ...star.. in the local Sesotho language.In two papers published this week in the open-access journal eLife, the researchers said that the more than 1,550 fossil elements documenting the discovery constituted the largest sample for any hominin species in a single African site, and one of the largest anywhere in the world. Further, the scientists said, that sample is probably a small fraction of the fossils yet to be recovered from the chamber. So far the team has recovered parts of at least 15 individuals....With almost every bone in the body represented multiple times, Homo naledi is already practically the best-known fossil member of our lineage,.. Dr. Berger said.The finding, like so many others in science, was the result of pure luck followed by considerable effort.Two local cavers, Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker, found the narrow entrance to the chamber, measuring no more than seven and a half inches wide. They were skinny enough to squeeze through, and in the light of their headlamps they saw the bones all around them. When they showed the fossil pictures to Pedro Boshoff, a caver who is also a geologist, he alerted Dr. Berger, who organized an investigation.Just getting into the chamber and bringing out samples proved to be a huge challenge.

Some of its primitive anatomy, like a brain no larger than an average orange, Dr. Berger said, indicated that the species evolved near or at the root of the Homo genus, meaning it must be in excess of 2.5 million to 2.8 million years old. Geologists think the cave is no older than three million years.The field work and two years of analysis for Dr. Berger..È latest discovery were supported by the University of the Witwatersrand, the National Geographic Society and the South African Department of Science and Technology/National Research Foundation. In addition to the journal articles, the findings will be featured in the October issue of National Geographic Magazine and in a two-hour NOVA/National Geographic documentary to air Wednesday on PBS.Scientists on the discovery team and those not involved in the research noted the mosaic of contrasting anatomical features, including more modern-looking jaws and teeth and feet, that warrant the hominin..È placement as a species in the genus Homo, not Australopithecus, the genus that includes the famous Lucy species that lived 3.2 million years ago. The hands of the newly discovered specimens reminded some scientists of the earliest previously identified specimens of Homo habilis, who were apparently among the first toolmakers.At a news conference on Wednesday, John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, a senior author of the paper describing the new species, said it was ...unlike any other species seen before,.. noting that a small skull with a brain one-third the size of modern human braincases was perched atop a very slender body. An average H. naledi was about five feet tall and weighed almost 100 pounds, he said.Tracy Kivell of the University of Kent, in England, an associate of Dr. Berger..È team, was struck by H. naledi..È ...extremely curved fingers, more curved than almost any other species of early hominin, which clearly demonstrates climbing capabilities...William Harcourt-Smith of Lehman College, another researcher at the Museum of Natural History, led the analysis of the feet of the new species, which he said are ...virtually indistinguishable from those of modern humans... These feet, combined with its long legs, suggest that H. naledi was well suited for upright long-distance walking, Dr. Harcourt-Smith said.In an accompanying commentary in the journal, Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, found overall similarities between the new species and fossils from Dmanisi, in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, dated to about 1.8 million years ago. The Georgian specimens are usually assigned to an early variety of Homo erectus.Much remains to be discovered in the Rising Star Cave, like determining the ages of the fossils and the evolutionary position of H. naledi in the genus Homo and the human family tree. The discovery chamber has not given up all of its secrets. ...There are potentially hundreds if not thousands of remains of H. naledi still down there,.. Dr. Berger said.At the news conference in South Africa on Thursday announcing the findings, Dr. Berger said: ...I do believe that the field of paleoanthropology had convinced itself, as much as 15 years ago, that we had found everything, that we were not going to make major discoveries and had this story of our origins figured out.

Records labelled ...secret advice to the minister.. were part of 500 pages of briefing material prepared for a new deputy minister when she arrived at Environment Canada a few months after the meetings....Strategists from the communication branch were involved in Environment Canada..È deliberations on its contribution to the deficit action reduction plan from the beginning,.. said the records, released through Access to Information. They also showed that Environment Canada..È human resources branch managers stayed in touch with both the Prime Minister..È Office and the Privy Council Office....That sounds a bit backwards to me,.. Gary Corbett, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, which represents about 60,000 government scientists and professionals, told Postmedia journalist Mike De Souza. ...It..È wrong for communications people to be involved in deciding what decisions to make. Communications people are there to communicate the decisions after they..Èe made. It seems the government is just being political rather than [doing] what..È in the best interests of Canadians...The Harper government is especially sensitive about any scientific research that shows the extraction of oil from the bitumen sands of northern Alberta is a threat to the environment or to people. Environment Canada researchers Derek Muir and Jane Kirk agreed with findings by University of Alberta scientists Erin Kelly and David Schindler that contaminants are accumulating in snow near the oilsands quarries. While the university scientists could discuss their findings with the media, the government scientists could not.The University of Alberta scientists..Èreport was presented in November 2011 at a conference in Boston of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. ...[Environment Canada..È] research conducted during winter 2010...11 confirms results already published by the University of Alberta that show contaminants in snow in the oilsands area,.. an Environment Canada memorandum admitted, but the authors of the document warned: ...If scientists are approached for interviews at the conference, the EC [Environment Canada] communications policy will be followed by referring the journalist to the media relations . . . phone number. An appropriate spokesperson will then be identified depending on journalist questions...The document was obtained through Access to Information by Postmedia..È Mike De Souza, who had been bird-dogging the government on its cover-up of data that might cause trouble for oil extraction companies. (Their problem was solved when De Souza was laid off in 2014, when Postmedia shut down its Ottawa bureau. The Postmedia chain no longer has a full-time environment reporter on Parliament Hill.)Environment Canada scientists were told to say, ...I am a scientist. I..È not in a position to answer that question, but I..È be happy to refer you to an appropriate spokesperson... The official line was: ...We are comparing the levels of contamination we found in our work to other studies and find that other studies report both higher and lower levels. These efforts will allow us to better understand deposition patterns and levels of oilsands related contaminants with a view to better identify their sources and ecological risks...By the sixth year of the Harper regime, most scientists knew it was foolish and dangerous to try to buck the system. The Index on Censorship took a survey of 4,000 Canadian scientists in 2013. Only 14 per cent said they felt they would be able to share a concern about public health and safety, or a threat to the environment, without fear of retaliation or censure from their department or agency.Once the Harper government had scientists under its control, it went after their research libraries. First, Health Canada turned over its interlibrary loan system to a company called Infotrieve. Every time a researcher wanted material from a scientific journal article, a book from a university library or a publication from a federal or provincial agency, Infotrieve billed the scientist..È department. To save money and aggravation, some research scientists started borrowing university library cards from co-op students and friends who taught in universities so they could get the interlibrary loan material for free. Others had to ask friends working for private companies to get government-owned research material for them.Health Canada..È head office library was shut down. The books and journals, essential for serious research, were sent to the National Science Library on the Ottawa campus of the National Research Council in 2013. Rudi Mueller, who left Health Canada in 2012, says the department simply did not want it to be easy for scientists to use libraries. ...I look at it as an insidious plan to discourage people from using libraries,.. Mueller said. ...If you want to justify closing a library, you make access difficult and then you say it is hardly used...Scientists like Mueller were not just kept away from books. They were also unable to get help from trained science librarians who know how to track down publications that are obscure, rare or hard to get. Health Canada had 40 of these librarians. In April 2013, it had six. ...A librarian is far better at doing a literature search than I am,.. Mueller said. ...It..È their profession... Mueller said the research support system had become absurd and, by the end of his career with Health Canada, he believed he wasn..È able to do his work properly.At least one Health Canada scientist started his own library, squirrelling away 250 feet of shelf space worth of books and journals in his basement. Friends who work for the department email him with requests, and the scientist tracks the material down and brings it to work.If the plan was designed to save money, it..È been a failure. Health Canada Library Services had a staff of 36 and a budget of $1.75 million in 2008...2009. In 2013...2014 there was a staff of six and the cost had risen to $2.67 million. On top of that, each time a Health Canada scientist needs a document, the department has to pay a $25.65 retrieval fee plus the courier bill from the National Science Library. Scientists are charged $9 for a scanned, emailed document.Former Green Party activist Katie Gibbs, who holds a PhD in biology specializing in conservation science, organized the Death of Evidence marches in 2012. She believes the Harper government doesn..È want to hear from scientists, even those who work in the federal bureaucracy. ...I think there are multiple ways to avoid using scientific evidence in policy development. One way is to not collect it and get rid of historical documentary information,.. Gibbs said....A picture does say a thousand words. You see pictures of dumpsters full of books. It..È alarming. You see lots of examples of private companies picking up these books. I..Èe heard from so many scientists who took the material home because they couldn..È stand to see this material thrown out. Scientists are sending out emails to each other saying what they have stored away. It..È having an impact on the ability of scientists to do their job,.. she said.Historians have faced the same kind of cuts. In Harper..È Canada, history comes from the Centre, not from the work of the professors and authors who depend on easy access to the vast collection of documents and pictures at Library and Archives Canada (LAC). Inside its Ottawa building, just a block from Parliament Hill, services have been slashed, employee morale is dismal and visiting scholars are angry.The words ...dusty.. and ...archives.. are usually used in the same breath by people who don..È understand that history is a living thing that can, and often is, remade to suit political agendas. History is also often hidden by governments that want to write their own narrative of what a country..È about. The archives is so poor that it..È missed out on important historical letters, a collection of narratives from fugitive slaves in Upper Canada from 1856, and letters from British colonial officials on the state of First Nations in eastern Canada during pioneer times. In 2008...2009, Library and Archives Canada spent $385,461 on historic documents. In 2011...2012 it spent nothing. In Washington, the Library of Congress..È acquisition budget was between $18 million and $19 million annually from 2009 to 2012.In the early years of this century, Library and Archives Canada started working on a project to make its collection accessible to everyone. First, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King..È diary and documents from New France were posted on the Internet. Probably the department..È heart was in the right place, but the plan has been a failure. Six years into the digitalization project, there was very little to show for it except frustration, with LAC staff and managers unable to get the system running properly and Canadians finding it not very helpful.When people have asked for material that is politically sensitive, Library and Archives Canada, prompted by its overseers in the Heritage Ministry and the Prime Minister..È Office, has dug in its heels. Since 2005, Canadian Press reporter Jim Bronskill has been trying to see the RCMP security service file on one-time federal NDP leader and Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas, who died in 1986. The file is 1,149 pages thick, but Bronskill received just 400 heavily censored pages when he filed his first request. Library and Archives Canada released another 300 pages of the file just before Bronskill..È case was heard by the Federal Court, and Bronskill got some more of the file after the court ruled in his favour. The material that has been released shows the country..È national police force tailed a mainstream elected politician for almost 60 years and watched him long after he retired to see if he was involved with communists, members of the peace movement or anyone else identified by the police as a danger to the state.The federal government outsourced some of the archives..Èwork to ancestry.ca, a for-profit website used by genealogists. People can go to the archives building and use this service without paying, but if they to want use census material from the comfort of their home, they..È better have their credit card handy.To do the job right, a national archives still needs archivists ... many of them skilled historians ... to help professional and amateur researchers who come to Ottawa to use the collection. But rather than increase Library and Archives Canada..È budget so it can do its job, the Harper government has cut it. It may scold Canadians and immigrants for not knowing their history, but it has made it much harder for people to study and write about the past. Along with preventing the archives from adding to the nation..È collection, cuts have manifested themselves in reduced hours, slower service, lack of access to important documents, and slashing of staff. The ones who still have their jobs often seem overwhelmed and overworked.In May 2012, more than 200 people, many of them experts with unique skills and years of experience, lost their jobs. People who arranged for loans of material in the collection, specialists who preserved microfilm, digital experts and reference librarians were tossed out. Training was cut. Half the LAC circulation staff who dealt with analog material ... what the rest of us call books and documents ... were fired. The library also killed its interlibrary loan program. In its last year in the interlibrary loan system, the national library lent 20,000 books to people across the country, often in isolated communities.Morale among the surviving staff, which was never very good, has tanked. Rather than deal with the lousy work environment, Daniel Caron, the former head of Library and Archives Canada, simply gagged his employees. He was trained as an economist, not a librarian or archivist, and his tenure saw a rapid deterioration in services and morale. Like other managers in the Harper government, Caron wanted to put the screws to employees who might gripe to the public.Caron and his management team came up with a code of conduct banning librarians and archivists from setting foot in classrooms, attending conferences and speaking at public meetings, whether on the institution..È time or their own. The 23 pages of rules, called ...Library and Archives Canada..È Code of Conduct: Values and Ethics,.. came into effect in January 2013. Employees could get special dispensation from their bosses, but the fine print of the gag order made it unlikely that permission would be granted. The rules called public speaking, whether to university students, genealogy groups, historians and even other archivists and librarians, ...high risk.. activities that could create conflicts of interest or ...other risks to LAC... The code stressed federal employees..È...duty of loyalty.. not to history or to Library and Archives Canada, but rather to the ...duly elected government... Employees breaking the code could find themselves reported to LAC managers by colleagues who turned them in on what James Turk, executive director of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, called a ...snitch line......As public servants, our duty of loyalty to the Government of Canada and its elected officials extends beyond our workplace to our personal activities,.. the code said. It reminded librarians and archivists, many of whom do not consider themselves public menaces, that they must maintain awareness of their surroundings, their audience and how their words or actions could be interpreted (or misinterpreted). They were warned not to fall into the trap of social media. And LAC employees were warned that teaching a class or speaking at a conference put them at special risk, since ...such activities have been identified as high risk to Library and Archives Canada and to the employee with regard to conflict of interest, conflict of duties and duty of loyalty...In March 2013, Harper..È hometown paper, the Calgary Herald, editorialized: ...The code appears overly concerned with what an employee might say about the federal government. Speaking at a conference about the role of archivists, for example, cannot by anyone..È wildest imagination be construed as disloyal. This unwarranted dictate severely limiting the librarians..Èand archivists..Èfreedom of speech is intolerable and must be reversed...Caron was one person who was allowed to speak out. ...Library and Archives Canada..È Code of Conduct for its employees is wholly consistent with the values of the Public Service of Canada,.. he wrote in a letter to the editor of the Ottawa Citizen. ...Library and Archives Canada..È Code of Conduct does not prevent Library and Archives employees from engaging in external activities. However, for all public servants, the right to freedom of expression must be balanced with their responsibility to remain impartial and effective in their professional duties. This is commonly applied in the private and public sector...That chattiness came to an abrupt end in May 2013, after Caron was called into Heritage Minister James Moore..È office to explain why Library and Archives Canada..È leader billed the government nearly $4,500 for Spanish lessons. Soon afterwards, the New Democrats released a document outlining what the party..È heritage critic, Pierre Nantel, called Caron..È ...titanic expenses... The publicly available figures show Caron filed $87,000 in expense claims in each of 2011 and 2012. Moore..È own expenses were about $46,000 in each of those years. Caron submitted expenses for business lunches in Ottawa..È best restaurants and the private Rideau Club, and for rooms in expensive hotels in Quebec City and Puerto Rico, along with trips to Toronto, Europe and Australia. Suddenly, Caron was out of a job.Just a month after Caron left, the archives finally opened its wallet to buy some Canadiana. It was obvious Library and Archives Canada had learned a lesson on how to serve its masters in the Prime Minister..È Office. Library and Archives Canada chipped in with the Canadian Museum of Civilization (now the Canadian Museum of History) to spend almost $700,000 on a collection of documents and artifacts belonging to Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. It fit with the War of 1812 fetish. The collection was described as ...the largest and most complete collection of War of 1812 documentation ever.. in the government..È announcement, which was made by Heritage Minister Moore.Library and Archives Canada would carry on, at least for War of 1812 buffs, but its staff would continue to tread very, very carefully.",22.01,7.31,3.05,4.26,16.36,11.71,5.36,2.8,3.66,1.63,4.65,5.18,0.18,0,0,0,2.06,1,0
88,0,"Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around the world. The labour-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom, cayenne, tamarind and other flavours can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people.But behind the appeal of Indian food -  what makes it so novel and so delicious -  is also a stranger and subtler truth. In a large new analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes, data scientists have discovered perhaps the key reason why Indian food tastes so unique: it does something radical with flavours, something very different from what we tend to do in the United States and the rest of western culture. And it does it at the molecular level.Before we go further, let's take a step back and consider what flavours are and how they interact. If you were to hold a microscope to most western dishes, you would find an interesting but not all-too-surprising trend. Popular food pairings in this part of the world combine ingredients that share like flavours, which food chemists have broken down into their molecular parts -  precise chemical compounds that, when combined, give off a distinct taste.Most of the compounds have scientific names, though one of the simpler compounds is acetal, which, as the food chemist George Burdock has written, is ...refreshing, pleasant, and (has a) fruity-green odour... It can be found in whiskey, apple juice, orange juice and raw beets. On average, there are just over 50 flavour compounds in each food ingredient.A chart shared by Scientific American in 2013 shows which foods share the most flavour compounds with others and which food pairings have the most flavour compounds in common. Peanut butter and roasted peanuts have one of the most significant overlaps (no surprise there). But there are connections that are more difficult to predict: strawberries, for instance, have more in common with white wine than they do with apples, oranges or honey.Chefs in the West like to make dishes with ingredients that have overlapping flavours. But not all cuisines adhere to the same rule. Many Asian cuisines have been shown to belie the trend by favouring dishes with ingredients that don't overlap in flavour. And Indian food, in particular, is one of the most powerful counter-examples.Researchers at the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur crunched data on several thousand recipes from a popular online recipe site called TarlaDalal.com. They broke each dish down to its ingredients, and then compared how often and heavily ingredients share flavour compounds.The answer? Not too often.The researchers examined several thousand recipes, which used a total of 200 ingredients. They looked at how much the underlying flavour compounds overlapped in single dishes and discovered something very different from western cuisines. Indian cuisine tended to mix ingredients whose flavours don't overlap at all....We found that average flavour sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected,.. the researchers wrote.In other words, the more overlap two ingredients have in flavour, the less likely they are to appear in the same Indian dish.More specifically, many Indian recipes contain cayenne, the basis of curry powder that is in dishes such as red curry, green curry, or massaman curry. And when a dish contains cayenne, the researchers found, it's unlikely to have other ingredients that share similar flavours. The same can be said of green bell pepper, coriander and garam masala, which are nearly as ubiquitous in Indian cuisine....Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavour sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients,.. the researchers noted.Milk, butter, bread and rice, meanwhile -  all of which are hallmarks of western cuisine -  were found to be associated with just the opposite: flavour pairings that match. When any of those ingredients appeared in an Indian dish, there was a good chance there would be a lot of flavour overlap.The take-away is that part of what makes Indian food unique is the way flavours rub up against each other. The cuisine is complicated, no doubt: the average Indian dish, after all, contains at least seven ingredients. But all those ingredients are important because in any single dish, each one brings its own flavour.",19.58,8.2,1.75,6.45,14.25,11.16,6.18,4.7,7.8,0.54,5.11,6.59,0.54,0,0.13,0,0.81,0,0

It proved that neutrinos must have mass, a finding that upset the Standard Model of particle physics and opened new avenues for research into the fundamental properties of the universe.McDonald, 72, shares the prize with Takaaki Kajita, whose Japanese collaboration made the same discovery with slightly different methods.To measure solar neutrinos, McDonald and a 130-person international team built a massive detector in an operational copper mine southwest of Sudbury. The location allowed the experiment to be highly sensitive but created enormous logistical challenges. Construction on the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory ... SNO ... began in 1990. The experiment collected its first data nine years later....I think we all knew that if we could manage to do it, it would be a very significant measurement.

90,0,"Death and rebirth are the bookends of time.For over 4.5 billion years, each day on Earth has begun the same way: with the rising of the sun.But earth scientists look for greater changes, choosing great extinctions or periods of evolution to mark the passing of one geological period into another.Our destiny, some might argue, first began when fish climbed out of the primordial oceans and onto the shore some 400 million years ago during the Paleozoic Era.But it was during the Holocene Epoch, after the Pleistocene Ice Ages ended, that humans turned from hunting and gathering to organizing social groups, thus forming the civilizations of the world.Some say we are still in the Holocene. But others have begun to wonder if we may now be living in a new epoch, one defined by the environmental consequences of man.This new time period, dubbed the anthropocene in 2000 by biologist Eugene F. Stoermer and Nobel-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen, it marks the most recent interval of geological time that is characterized by how human activities forever changed the geography and climate of the planet.But when, exactly, was that?If the anthropocene were to become an official epoch, it would be the first time a geological boundary could be witnessed by scientifically literate human beings.But first, scientists must come up with a start date. Some argue it began in the Industrial Revolution, when factories caused an increase in carbon emissions. Others have said it began earlier than that, when agriculture caused widespread deforestation. Still others have argued that it began much more recently, in the second half of the 20th century.Alex Wolfe, a professor at University of Alberta, believes that the anthropocene started during the Great Acceleration, a term used by scientists to describe rapid climate change in the last half of the 20th century.This is when, Wolfe said, human activity did more than just impact the planet -  it actually started to control it.Wolfe is in favour of formally recognizing the Anthropocene Epoch. But in order to find an official start date for the epoch, he said, we have to find a ...geological horizon...As part of the Anthropocene Working Group, he published a paper in the Quaternary International that argued for a distinct start date: July 16, 1945, the Trinity atomic bomb tests.Although that date carries great weight in the pages of human history, he said it was chosen not because it's a metaphor, but because it can be measured. The bomb and subsequent nuclear fallout has left radioactive footprints in rock formations that will serve as a marker for thousands of years....We're essentially using the nuclear test as a pageholder for a series of events that represent, in our mind, a transformation of the earth system,.. he said.But William Ruddiman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Virginia, thinks it goes back much farther than that....[The atom bomb] is an important marker in human history, but it's not even close to the whole story,.. he said.In a paper published in the journal Science, Ruddiman argues that the anthropocene began thousands of years ago, when humans chopped down the forest to make way for agriculture....If you look out from space at the planet, the biggest change that would strike your eyes is that all these green forests have been turned into yellow meadows,.. he said.Starting the anthropocene in 1945, he said, would be like saying the Wild West was tamed when the Sears Tower was built in Chicago in 1970.End of an epoch?Right now, the anthropocene is an informal term used to describe a period of time when human impact on the planet became more pervasive. But in 2016, the International Commission on Stratigraphy will meet, and the Anthropocene Working Group hopes to submit a proposal in favour of making the Anthropocene Epoch an official time unit on the Geological Time Scale....Right now anthropocene means different things to different people,.. Wolfe said, arguing that it would be more useful if everyone could agree on what it is and when it began....These transformations are apace, they were begun decades ago, and their fingerprint is . . . absolutely pervasive,.. he said.But Ruddiman said that while he thinks it's a useful term, he's against turning the ...little a.. into a ...big-A Anthropocene......There are lots of important changes that humans have made, and they come in at lots of times and lots of places,.. Ruddiman said.The current geological time period, the Holocene Epoch, has lasted for 12,000 years. If Wolfe is right, and we're just 70 years into the Anthropocene Epoch, then we're really just starting to see what the consequences of human activities will look like for the planet....It's really just the beginning,.. he said.",20.67,8.81,2.98,5.83,14.02,15.38,5.83,3.47,3.97,0.74,4.84,7.32,0.25,0,0.25,0,2.48,0,0

92,0,"LOS ANGELES -  Selena Gomez wanted to control the music....Do you have an auxiliary cord?.. the grown-up tween idol asked her driver on a recent Monday afternoon, queuing up a Spotify playlist (...It's kind of all over the place..) and reaching into the front seat to crank the volume on a Christian rock song. One Direction, Nicki Minaj and the indie group Chromatics followed.Ms. Gomez, like seemingly every other 23-year-old in the country, scrolled inattentively through Instagram and agreed to order sushi via an app as she rapped along to Drake under her breath (...Trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers .._..).If she hadn't recalled her stint, at the age of 7, on ...Barney & Friends,.. it was almost possible to forget Ms. Gomez's child star bona fides: four seasons of a popular Disney show, ...Wizards of Waverly Place..; four studio albums under the company's music arm, Hollywood Records; and a soul-draining teen romance saga with Justin Bieber. But that's all in her past now -  sort of.In an attempt to declare her rebirth as an independent, confident adult woman, Ms. Gomez will release ...Revival,.. her first album for Interscope, on Oct. 9. Yet while the music's thematic awakenings (personal, professional, sexual) are meant to supplant her previous personas -  tidily packaged goody-goody in her work, baby bird with broken wings in the tabloids -  the songs are also savvily exploiting those same public stories and preconceptions.As Ms. Gomez sings on the album's opener: ...What I've learned is so vital/More than just survival/This is my revival...The risk, however, is getting bogged down in past associations that threaten to eclipse her obvious growth as a performer. So Ms. Gomez must mine her experiences while trying to avoid a pop star identity that's only refracted through others, be it Mr. Bieber or Taylor Swift, her longtime industry BFF who also sought in recent years to own the ugly chatter about her relationships with a new sense of agency and emphasis on female friendship.The run-up to the album had to be carefully considered: The lead single, ...Good for You,.. featuring a sly verse from ASAP Rocky, is a statement of self-worth and sexual power as breathy come-on, conjuring none of Ms. Gomez's ghosts. Only after its unexpected summer success -  the mid-tempo song recently hit No. 1 on Billboard's pop chart and landed at No. 5 on the Hot 100 -  did Interscope release the more obvious single ...Same Old Love,.. a defiant but wounded kiss-off about a trampled heart.When that was set to begin the campaign, ...I was like, that's not right,.. Ms. Gomez said. ...That's not going to be my narrative. Not right now...While she plans to address her past, she is hyper-aware of how she has been perceived. ...It's all part of my story,.. Ms. Gomez said while not quite relaxing in a Beverly Hills hotel suite before boarding the S.U.V. to rehearsal. ...I'm growing and changing. I was in a relationship, and I was being managed by my parents, and I was still under Hollywood and Disney, and I was being held to this expectation of being the good girl...She continued: ...I knew deep down that this wasn't what I wanted to do -  being exhausted of forcing something that wasn't right, even in my personal life. I had to have moments where I was crying and I was like, ...Why am I not in love with what I do?' I was forced to get very uncomfortable for a while in order to make the decisions I made...Even more liberating than leaving Disney, Ms. Gomez said, was letting her mother go as a manager last year, an experience she called ...very awkward.. and likened to ...a kid going to college... But suddenly decisions like posing almost naked on the cover of ...Revival.. became easier, she said.Poised without seeming robotic, Ms. Gomez can also be a ball of nerves, making her perhaps the most earthbound of her generation's Disney graduates (Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato). She said she is prone to overthinking, endures episodes of ...angst.. and is extra-sensitive to uncomfortable situations. (...Had major anxiety at the airport,.. she tweeted recently to more than 32 million followers. ...Not feeling good at all...)Years of paparazzi attention and interest in her barely pubescent love life contributed to the guarded uneasiness just under her shimmery surface. Ms. Gomez recalled thinking: ...I need my work to just outshine all of this because the noise is driving me crazy, and it's preventing me from leaving my home. When I walk into a place and people look at me, they don't see an artist...Still, she took to a new path tentatively. Rather than shattering her Disney halo and leaving loyal fans, known as ...Selenators,.. behind, Ms. Gomez matured in fits and starts, always referencing her past eras.PhotoSelena Gomez in ...Spring Breakers,.. with Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine and Vanessa Hudgens.

She laughed. ...That's not what happened...Hang-wringing over her role in the film erupted instantly. ...I had this weird moment where I was at the Toronto Film Festival, and during the day I premiered ...Hotel Transylvania' .. -  an animated film, rated PG -  ...then at night I premiered ...Spring Breakers,' .. she said. ...Of course there was controversy: ...Oh, she's in a bikini, and she's a role model...But the adult part played just enough against type, putting Ms. Gomez on new industry radars, including that of John Janick, now the chairman and chief executive of Interscope. ...I thought it was the perfect thing for her to do,.. he said of ...Spring Breakers.. -  ...a natural progression.. without ...completely abandoning what she came from...After Mr. Janick popped into a recording session to meet Ms. Gomez in 2013, the pair started a year of discussions about taking her music career in a similar direction. ...It was always about empowering her the right way, but making sure you're not jumping 10 steps ahead,.. he said. Ms. Gomez's album ...Stars Dance,.. released the same year by Hollywood, was another baby step toward an adult career and featured the Top 10 hit ...Come & Get It,.. her biggest song to date.Before signing with Interscope in December 2014, Ms. Gomez took a bigger stride toward independence with a final, contract-fulfilling single for Disney. ...The Heart Wants What It Wants.. begins with a tearful monologue and addresses her relationship with Mr. Bieber all but explicitly....My public life was doing all the speaking for me, for a moment,.. Ms. Gomez said. While the gossip press ...made it their mission to make me seem meek and small,.. she added, ...I translated that into my music...Her openness carried over to sessions for ...Revival... Along with producers and songwriters of the moment (the Max Martin acolytes Mattman & Robin, Hit-Boy, Benny Blanco), Ms. Gomez, who is listed as executive producer and has writing credits on six songs, worked with a slew of young women, including Charli XCX (...Same Old Love..), Julia Michaels (...Revival,.. ...Good for You..) and Chloe Angelides (the is-it-Bieber anthem ...Sober..).Justin Tranter, another ...Revival.. songwriter, said that Ms. Gomez was realistic about playing into the gossip. ...Those questions do come up while writing,.. he said. ...Of course we don't want everything to feel like it's feeding into the tabloids, but also we need the song to win. She's smart enough to know that...The release of ...Revival.. happens to coincide, for better or worse, with the re-emergence of a humbled Mr. Bieber, who faces a similar dilemma with a new album due Nov. 13. Asked recently by Ellen DeGeneres if his new single, ...What Do You Mean?,.. is about Ms. Gomez, he could only fidget and grimace. (Mr. Janick acknowledged the promotional overlap but added, ...We're not exploiting it in any way...)While avoiding speaking Mr. Bieber's name, Ms. Gomez said she was heartened by their parallel successes. ...While people were writing that I was stupid for being in it, this is what I always saw in him,.. she said. ...I'm like, duh!..PhotoFrom left, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards in August.

She's very open, so she brings out this other side of me... But after a night among starlets, Ms. Gomez returned home to the celebrity suburb of Calabasas, to eat cookies with her two roommates (a realtor and a nonprofit employee.)...In the last two years, I've seen Selena start to make her career her own,.. Ms. Swift said. ...She's separated her opinion out and prioritized it above anyone else's. Her childhood was defined by working hard, with the major business decisions primarily being made by others. The coolest part of watching her grow up has been seeing her gradually take the creative reins and start to steer the ship...Ms. Gomez said she's getting used to the autonomy. ...I definitely remind myself that I'm in control,.. she said. ...I feel like ultimately if I sit down and I think about a decision I need to make, it's really within myself.

94,0,"He was not above seducing a young model by showing interest in her father..È cancer. He promised other women his mentorship and career advice before pushing them for sex acts. And he tried to use financial sleight of hand to keep his wife from finding out about his serial philandering.Bill Cosby admitted to all of this and more over four days of intense questioning 10 years ago at a Philadelphia hotel, where he defended himself in a deposition for a lawsuit filed by a young woman who accused him of drugging and molesting her.Even as Mr. Cosby denied he was a sexual predator who assaulted many women, he presented himself in the deposition as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women ... a profile at odds with the popular image he so long enjoyed, that of father figure and public moralist.In the deposition, which Mr. Cosby has for years managed to keep private but was obtained by The New York Times, the entertainer comes across as alternately annoyed, mocking, occasionally charming and sometimes boastful, often blithely describing sexual encounters in graphic detail.He talked of the 19-year-old aspiring model who sent him her poem and ended up on his sofa, where, Mr. Cosby said, she pleasured him with lotion.He spoke with casual disregard about ending a relationship with another model so he could pursue other women. ...Moving on,.. was his phrase.He suggested he was skilled in picking up the nonverbal cues that signal a woman..È consent....I think I..È a pretty decent reader of people and their emotions in these romantic sexual things, whatever you want to call them,.. he said.Through it all, his manner was largely one of casual indifference.At one point in the first day of questioning, Dolores M. Troiani, the lawyer for the plaintiff in the case, Andrea Constand, a young woman who worked at Temple University as a basketball manager, seemed struck by Mr. Cosby..È jocular manner....I think you..Èe making light of a very serious situation,.. she said, to which Mr. Cosby replied: ...That may very well be...Interest in Mr. Cosby..È deposition grew this month when a federal judge unsealed a 62-page memorandum of law in the case, which had been settled in 2006. The memorandum contained excerpts from the deposition, including Mr. Cosby..È acknowledgment that he had obtained quaaludes as part of his effort to have sex with women.The parties have been prohibited from releasing the memorandum because of a confidentiality clause that was part of the settlement agreement, but the deposition itself was never sealed. This month, Ms. Constand..È lawyer asked the court to lift the confidentiality clause so her client would be free to release the nearly 1,000-page deposition transcript. The Times later learned that the transcript was already publicly available through a court reporting service.Mr. Cosby has never been charged with a crime and has repeatedly denied the accusations of sexual assault, now leveled by dozens of women. David Brokaw, Mr. Cosby..È publicist, did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. Ms. Troiani declined to comment. In three suits, women who accused Mr. Cosby of sexual misconduct are pursuing civil claims against him. In addition, the Los Angeles police have said they are reviewing a complaint of a sexual nature against Mr. Cosby.While Mr. Cosby described encounters with many women through the course of his deposition, it is through his long and detailed descriptions of his relationship with Ms. Constand, who is much younger, that Mr. Cosby..È attitudes, proclivities and approach to women are most clearly revealed. Ms. Constand was present for at least some of Mr. Cosby..È testimony in the Rittenhouse Hotel in Philadelphia.First spotting her at Temple University in the early 2000s, Mr. Cosby said he felt romantic interest immediately (...She..È good-looking..), and began a relationship that led, in his telling, to dinners and more.Asked how he wooed her, Mr. Cosby, who has been married since 1964, responded: ...Inviting her to my house, talking to her about personal situations dealing with her life, growth, education...He painted his relationship with Ms. Constand as one of mentor and mentee, casting himself in the role of an experienced guide and offering her the benefit of his contacts, fame and experience.At times he described becoming frustrated after Ms. Constand failed to follow his advice, such as when he wanted her to pursue her interest in sports broadcasting by calling someone and she did not. ...Here..È a mentor, Bill Cosby, who is in the business, Bill Cosby, who happens to know something about what to do and Andrea is not picking up on it,.. he said.Ms. Constand ultimately went to the police to complain of Mr. Cosby..È behavior, but in his telling, his seduction was one of persistence and patience.Early on in his courtship, he arranged an intimate meal alone with her at his Pennsylvania home, complete with Cognac, dimmed lights and a fire, he said. At one point he led her to his back porch, out of sight from his chef. ...I take her hair and I pull it back and I have her face like this,.. he said. ...And I..È talking to her ...And I talked to her about relaxing, being strong. And I said to her, come in, meaning her body...But the two remained inches apart, he said, and he did not try to kiss her because he did not sense she wanted him to. Nevertheless, at the next dinner he said they had what he described as a ...sexual moment,.. short of intercourse. He described her afterward as having ...a glow...Expounding on his philosophy about sex, Mr. Cosby said he tended to refrain from intercourse because he did not want women to fall in love with him. To him, he said, the act of sexual intercourse ...is something that I feel the woman will succumb to more of a romance and more of a feeling, not love, but it..È deeper than a playful situation... As far as he and Ms. Constand went, he said, they were ...playing sex, we..Èe playing, petting, we..Èe playing...Was he in love with her? ...No...Yet the association endured for a few years, until one night at his Pennsylvania home, when Ms. Constand said Mr. Cosby drugged and molested her.Mr. Cosby said he gave her one and a half tablets of Benadryl to relieve stress, they kissed and had sexual contact. Her lawyer said she believed it was a much more powerful drug.Some time later, after Ms. Constand had moved home to Canada, Mr. Cosby spoke with Ms. Constand..È mother on the telephone. The mother, he said, was upset about what her daughter said Mr. Cosby had done, describing the experience as ...a mother..È nightmare...In the deposition, he said he was worried that Ms. Constand..È mother would think of him as a ...dirty old man...During the call, Mr. Cosby told the deposing lawyers, he wanted Ms. Constand to tell her mother ...about the orgasm.. so that she would realize it was consensual....Tell your mother about the orgasm. Tell your mother how we talked,.. he said he remembered thinking.Subsequently, concerned that Ms. Constand and her mother might seek to embarrass him, he said he offered to help pay for Ms. Constand..È further education. Years earlier, he offered to reward another woman, Therese Serignese, whom he had met at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1976, with money as a bonus for good grades.It is difficult to say to what extent Mr. Cosby..È wife, Camille, was aware of her husband..È womanizing, though it was certainly clear to her by 1997, when Mr. Cosby acknowledged an affair. Mrs. Cosby suggested at the time that there had been marital problems but they had put them behind them.Still, in the deposition, Mr. Cosby, 78, described going to some lengths to hide his behavior, blocking a magazine article to avoid publicity and funneling money to one woman through his agent so ...Mrs. Cosby.. wouldn..È find out.In the case of Ms. Constand, who never sought any funds, Mr. Cosby said he imagined his wife would have known he was helping with her education. But, he said, ...My wife would not know it was because Andrea and I had had sex and that Andrea was now very, very upset and that she decided that she would like to go to school...While Mr. Cosby insisted the only drug he had given Ms. Constand was Benadryl, he was open about his access in the 1970s to quaaludes, a sedative also popular as a party drug.He said he obtained seven prescriptions for them over two to three years from a doctor in Los Angeles, ostensibly for a sore back but in reality to give to women.He admitted to giving young women quaaludes at that time ...the same as a person would say have a drink,.. he said, but not without their knowledge.Though he portrayed the drug-taking and sex as consensual, Mr. Cosby ... when asked whether Ms. Serignese was in a position to consent to sexual intercourse after he gave her quaaludes in 1976 ... said: ...I don..È know...Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for Ms. Serignese and two other women who are suing Mr. Cosby for defamation, said of the deposition: ...This information is important because it sheds light on the private practices of a man who holds himself out as a public moralist...During the questioning, Mr. Cosby cast himself as a sensitive and attentive supporter of Ms. Constand, though his tone changed when addressing Ms. Constand in the present tense.Asked by Ms. Constand..È lawyer about how he felt when Ms. Constand cried during her own deposition, Mr. Cosby was unsparing: ...I think Andrea is a liar and I know she..È a liar because I was there. I was there...And he could be dispassionate in recalling former relationships. With a woman named Beth Ferrier, a model he met in the 1980s, he recalled inquiring after her career and her father, who had died of cancer....Did you ask her those questions because you wanted to have sexual contact with her?.. Ms. Troiani asked....Yes,.. Mr. Cosby responded.Still, he said he viewed himself as a good person, worthy of trust, and chivalrous in his desire to never tell others about the women with whom he had sex....I am a man, the only way you will hear about who I had sex with is from the person I had it with,.. he said.In some passages, Mr. Cosby offered a glimpse into a life long insulated by perks and wealth. Some idiosyncrasies are revealed, like his penchant for sweatpants (he had at least 100, he said), how he used the name Seymour Rapaport as an alias in the 1970s and 1980s when he traveled, and how many of his employees signed confidentiality agreements.In the deposition, Mr. Cosby described sexual liaisons ... he sometimes calls them rendezvous ... with at least five women, and having a ...romantic.. interest in two more, in locations like Denver, Las Vegas and New York and Pennsylvania, in hotels or in one of his homes.In the court case, 13 women came forward with anonymous sworn statements to support Ms. Constand, saying that they, too, had been molested in some way by Mr. Cosby. But they never had a chance to pursue their claims in court because, six months after the fourth and final day of his deposition, Mr. Cosby settled the case with Ms. Constand on undisclosed terms. His deposition was filed away, another document in a settled court case, until now",23.67,14.71,10.89,3.82,15.62,13.94,6.06,3.72,3.92,1.37,7.53,7.74,0.25,0,0.1,0,2.85,0,0
95,0,"...Life is full of surprises,.. is how Pawel Pawlikowski, the Polish-born director of ...Ida,.. put it at the Oscars on Sunday night. And he was one of them. Mr. Pawlikowski managed to keep talking over the wrap-it-up music, which usually ushers off long-winded or lesser-known nominees, and actually finished his acceptance speech for best foreign language film.There weren't too many other surprises.One of the less predictable turn of events was the bland performance by Neil Patrick Harris, a veteran M.C. of both the Tony Awards and the Emmys, who hosted the Oscars for the first time on Sunday. His one successful stretch was a parody of a scene from ...Birdman,.. in which Michael Keaton runs through Times Square in his underpants. Mr. Harris ran through backstage corridors and onto the stage in white briefs and his black socks and shoes. But because Mr. Harris is in good physical shape, there wasn't much humor or bravery to the sketch, just bravado.Oscar nights almost always drag on too long, but this one was a slog almost from the very beginning. Mr. Harris dutifully did a song tribute to old Hollywood, and Jack Black ran up on stage to express the self-loathing of new Hollywood, ranting about an ...industry in flux,.. big budget movies about superheroes and formulaic scripts.That may have been a reaction to the best picture nominations -  seven of the eight are not big studio films, but independent movies that found a niche audience. None of them made nearly as much money as ...American Sniper.. (or for that matter, ...The Lego Movie..).There were some moments that went against the usual Oscar formula of tears and gratitude. Patricia Arquette's feminist call to arms at the end of her acceptance speech for supporting actress was unexpected and fierce. ...We have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America,.. she said as Meryl Streep and others roared their approval....Citizenfour,.. about the National Security Agency leaker Edward J. Snowden, won best documentary, and its makers thanked Mr. Snowden, who is still in Russia, for his courage. Mr. Harris joked that Mr. Snowden ...couldn't be here for some treason...Oscar nights usually do have their share of political posturing, but this was a particularly passionate evening.This year, in addition to Ms. Arquette's speech, the question of race in Hollywood was addressed with both humor -  in his opening monologue, Mr. Harris made a barbed allusion to the lack of diversity among the Academy by saying, ...Tonight we honor Hollywood's best and whitest, sorry, brightest.. -  and emotion. The latter came at the hands of actors, musicians and others who wanted to express indignation that the director of ...Selma,.. Ava DuVernay, wasn't nominated and neither was David Oyelowo, who played the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. When the audience applauded Mr. Oyelowo, who participated in a bit with Mr. Harris, the host said with a smirk, ...Oh sure, now you like him...As John Legend and Common accepted the Oscar for their song, ...Glory,.. from ...Selma,.. Mr. Legend urged the audience to join the struggle to protect voting rights and called the United States ...the most incarcerated country in the world,.. saying that there are now more ...black men under correctional control than were under slavery in 1850...The political speeches were somber, but they turned out to be more lively and bracing than any of Mr. Harris's skits.",22.04,7.56,3.36,4.2,15.29,10.76,6.05,4.03,5.71,0.67,7.06,7.23,0,0,0,0,5.38,1,0

The Shanghai composite fell 7.4 percent on Friday. The Shenzhen composite fell even more, dropping 7.9 percent. Share prices in Hong Kong, which is regulated separately, also fell, by 1.8 percent.Analysts had been warning for months about the risks of a stock market bubble in China, where giddy investors have driven up stock prices by purchasing shares on margin, or with money borrowed from brokers.China..È market has been an anomaly. Even though the broader Chinese economy has been relatively weak, share prices of many Chinese-listed companies have skyrocketed in the last year. Many traded at record valuations, often 80, 90 or 100 times their projected earnings.The high valuations have been a boon for listed companies and their major shareholders. The market boom has also helped encourage a wave of Chinese companies that had listed in the United States to arrange stock buyouts and delist with the intention of eventually relisting in China, where stock valuations are much higher.In the last few months, some well-known Chinese companies have announced plans to buy back shares and delist from the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, including Wuxi Pharma Tech, HomeInn Hotels and Qihoo 360, the Internet services provider, whose management offered $9 billion in a buyout.But China..È roaring stock market showed in the week just past how volatile prices can be: Shenzhen..È main index fell the previous week, then rose early last week, then tumbled again.Authorities are moving to tighten rules on buying stock with borrowed money, which is believed to be one of the key drivers of a stock market rally that has sent share prices to seven-year highs.The regulators are also trying to crack down on financing from unregulated sources, what analysts refer to as over-the-counter stock margin financing.Continue reading the main storyContinue reading the main storyRELATED COVERAGEStock prices on Friday at a securities firm in Fuyang, Anhui Province.

After her daughter graduated from an expensive private college, Ms. Illiano thought her days of paying big bills for her daughter were over.She was wrong. Her daughter, who is in her 20s, was not able to find a good-paying job and ended up moving in with her mother. That was just the beginning. Ms. Illiano co-signed for a leased car, repaid some of her daughter..È credit card debt and even paid for her nails, vacations and some clothes....My teacher benefits are awesome, but she won..È have any of that,.. said Ms. Illiano, 55, who is divorced. And that..È just fine with Ms. Illiano....I told my daughter to go for her dream,.. she said, explaining that she wanted her ...to have her financial legs...Ms. Illiano..È financial leg up for her daughter, however, has a downside. She is dipping into her own retirement funds, which means she is now looking at a couple of difficult choices: working longer or selling her home, which is already being used as collateral for her daughter..È student loan.More older parents are facing challenges like Ms. Illiano..È. They are helping their adult children by dishing out loans or cash gifts, or paying bills. But this largess sometimes blows a big hole in their finances, even jeopardizing their retirement. As a result, some older adults are going back to work, reducing their own living expenses or even declaring bankruptcy.While rigorous data is difficult to obtain, several reports suggest that the problems associated with supporting adult children are growing. At the same time, many baby boomers are far short of holding enough in their retirement accounts to support themselves into old age....Some adult children aren..È making enough money,.. said Netiva Heard, a certified debt counselor at MNH Credit Solutions in Chicago. ...So parents are taking over certain bills like credit cards, cellphones and rent...Parents, of course, want the best for their children from the moment they are born and are used to doing everything they can to help them. Continuing that support into adulthood has spread, experts say, largely because the economy of the last decade has fallen short in generating good job opportunities for their millennial children....But the last thing you want is for your kids to end up taking care of you financially,.. Ms. Heard said. ...And, anyway, kids can learn from their own money struggles...Baby boomers face increasing retirement challenges of their own as traditional defined benefit pensions have been widely replaced by riskier 401(k) plans and the like, which require disciplined savings. Many have not done the comprehensive financial planning needed to factor in the greater chance that they will live longer, or accumulated enough in savings and investments to cover future health expenses....So they..Èe not looking at the long-term effects of shelling out $5,000 or so per year to adult kids,.. said Jamie Hopkins, associate professor of taxation at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. ...That money could be funding an I.R.A. contribution...There are clear warning signs, experts said, that parents may be giving their adult children too much money. These include taking loans from 401(k) accounts, failing to make full retirement account contributions or draining savings.Take Jacquelyn McClellan, 74, who lives in Orange City, Fla. In what admittedly is an extreme case, Ms. McClellan, a retired program analyst for the federal government, began paying for various expenses for her grandchildren after her son said he could not afford them. She paid for dancing school, parochial school, trips to Disneyland, all with the help of money from her pension.These payments ended up tipping Ms. McClellan into bankruptcy in 2011. Since then, Ms. McClellan has sharply dialed back her own lifestyle. She can..È go on vacation cruises and has only minimal savings.Still, Ms. McClellan felt a sense of duty to help out her grandchildren. ...I didn..È want them to have a bad life,.. she said, adding that they are now flourishing.Giving some financial help can be a much-needed balm for family members. The problem is, many parents approaching or already in retirement do not know where they stand financially and how much they can afford to give without undermining their own security.Giving gifts of money to chronically needy adult children can become expensive very quickly.To solve a money squeeze, avoid giving away inheritances early, said Eric J. Schaefer, a certified financial planner at Evermay Wealth Management in Arlington, Va. Adult children often only end up coming back for more money, he explained.Supporting more extravagant expenses like a fancy car or country club memberships should be cut off altogether, Mr. Schaefer recommended.One-time loans, or gifts, that are used to pay for unexpected emergencies like medical expenses require little thought for parents who can afford them.But going back to the money trough time and time again is dangerous. ...Look at kids and ask, ...What is the money for?..È. said Robert J. Semrad in Chicago, the senior partner at DebtStoppers, a bankruptcy law firm. ...Is this a solution to the problem or just a Band-Aid? Many times money given as a Band-Aid merely delays the inevitable...Avoid co-signing loans for cars or homes, Mr. Semrad said, since a parent..È own credit can be jeopardized. ...Banks can go after co-signers,.. he said. ...And having assets makes you more susceptible...Properly drafted loans by parents to their children can teach the children valuable financial lessons, though. The keys, experts said, are to give the loans set terms and to establish a regular repayment schedule.Peter Lazaroff, a financial adviser at Plancorp in Missouri, recommends loans that include interest rates. The loan then works just like a bond, he added, and the parent gets back principal and interest. The child should also sign a contract, which can be drafted by a lawyer. A loan that is not paid back can be deducted from an inheritance.Kathleen Gurney, who runs the Financial Psychology Corporation in Florida, encouraged parents to structure a loan as if a son or daughter were a business partner. The contract should include loan terms, length and consequences for nonpayment....Loaning money works well,.. she said, ...if the process is objective and well planned...Ms. Gurney has seen many cases in which older parents helped their adult children, only to end up in dire financial straits themselves. One couple she counseled had to return to work part time in a restaurant because they had decided to support their divorced son..È wife and children....These financial decisions can affect your health and marriage,.. she said. ...And some people even slip into depression because they must continue to work...Experts also caution against giving a loan to an adult child who clearly cannot repay it. Family loans, they point out, are common, but being paid back is less so.Instead of cash, parents can offer their children networking help in looking for a job and provide other forms of support. But when gifts or loans are involved, the most important thing is to be honest with yourself ... and your children....Tough love,.. said Mr. Hopkins at the American College, ...requires parents to plan what they give their children. So you must have a process in place...",16.63,9.62,6.58,3.05,12.83,14.6,5.45,3.69,3.69,1.36,7.22,7.3,0.08,0,0.16,0,3.29,0,0
104,0,"Here is something every non-rich American family should know: The odds are that you will run out of money in retirement.On average, a typical working family in the anteroom of retirement ... headed by somebody 55 to 64 years old ... has only about $104,000 in retirement savings, according to the Federal Reserve..È Survey of Consumer Finances.That..È not nearly enough. And the situation will only grow worse.The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that more than half of all American households will not have enough retirement income to maintain the living standards they were accustomed to before retirement, even if the members of the household work until 65, two years longer than the average retirement age today.Using a different, more complex model, the Employee Benefit Research Institute calculates that 83 percent of baby boomers and Generation Xers in the bottom fourth of the income distribution will eventually run short of money. Higher up on the income scale, people also face challenges: More than a quarter of those with incomes between the middle of the income distribution and the 75th percentile will probably run short.The standard prescription is that Americans should put more money aside in investments. The recommendation, however, glosses over a critical driver of unpreparedness: Wall Street is bleeding savers dry....Everybody..È big focus is that we have to save more,.. said John C. Bogle, founder and former chief executive of Vanguard, the investment management colossus. ...A greater part of the problem is the failure of investors to earn their fair share of market returns...His observation suggests a different policy prescription: shoring up Americans..Èretirement requires, first of all, aligning the interests of investment advisers and their clients.A research paper by Mr. Bogle published in Financial Analysts Journal makes the case. Actively managed mutual funds, in which many workers invest their retirement savings, are enormously costly.First, there is the expense ratio ... about 1.12 percent of assets for the average large capitalization blend fund. Then there are transaction costs and distribution costs. Active funds also pay a penalty for keeping a share of their assets in low-yielding cash. Altogether, costs add up to 2.27 percent per year, Mr. Bogle estimates.By contrast, a passive index fund, like Vanguard..È Total Stock Market Index Fund, costs merely 0.06 percent a year in all.Of course, Mr. Bogle has a horse in the race. He founded the Vanguard Group. He invented the first index fund for the public. His case is powerful, nonetheless.Assuming an annual market return of 7 percent, he says, a 30-year-old worker who made $30,000 a year and received a 3 percent annual raise could retire at age 70 with $927,000 in the pot by saving 10 percent of her wages every year in a passive index fund. (Such a nest egg, at the standard withdrawal rate of 4 percent, would generate an inflation-adjusted $37,000 a year more or less indefinitely.) If she put it in a typical actively managed fund, she would end up with only $561,000.We might have seen this building decades ago. As companies gradually did away with the defined-benefit pensions that once provided working families with their main supplement to Social Security, workers found they had to shoulder the responsibility and risk of saving and investing for retirement largely on their own.In 1979, almost two in five private sector workers had a defined-benefit pension that would pay out a check until they died. Today only 14 percent do. Almost one in three, by contrast, must make do with a retirement savings account alone to supplement their Social Security check.If there is an industry rived with conflicts of interest, it is the financial conglomerates that advise Americans on investing these savings. Yet nobody was paying attention to the safeguards that might be needed when corporate retirement funds managed by sophisticated professionals were replaced by individual 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts....Wall Street makes no money on low-cost index funds,.. said David F. Swensen, who runs the investment portfolio for Yale. ...That is the problem...It..È not hard to find evidence of Wall Street..È rapaciousness.Sendhil Mullainathan of Harvard and colleagues from M.I.T. and the University of Hamburg sent ...mystery shoppers.. to visit financial advisers. They found that advisers mostly recommended investment strategies that fit their own financial interests. They reinforced their clients..Èmisguided biases, encouraging them to chase returns and advising against low-cost options like low-fee index funds.Another study, by Susan Christoffersen of the University of Toronto and colleagues from the University of Virginia and the University of Pennsylvania, found that investment advisers directed more of their clients..Èmoney to funds that shared the upfront fees with them.

Workers can have money automatically deducted from their paychecks, and they can contribute to the accounts directly, using electronic transfers from a checking or savings account.No minimum deposit is required, no fees are charged, and depositors have no risk of losing money, according to the Treasury Department. Workers may contribute up to $5,500 a year, or $6,500 if they are 50 or older, with a maximum total of $15,000. Participants may withdraw their contributions tax-free and without a penalty, so the money can be used for emergencies if needed.

For 2015 as a whole, the bank now predicts growth of 2.1 per cent, well below its previous forecast of 2.4 per cent.While Poloz..È move may help the economy, in the short run it could increase pressure on Prime Minister Stephen Harper..È government to revise its economic approach. The strategy currently hinges on eliminating the federal budget deficit to open the way for $5 billion a year in new spending and tax breaks for families, particularly a controversial plan to allow spouses to split income for tax purposes. Because only about 15 per cent of families would benefit from this $2-billion annual measure, it has been sharply criticized as a waste of valuable financial resources.Taking into account the new spending announcements by Harper in the fall, falling oil prices put the federal government in danger of running another budget deficit in 2015 instead of meeting its claim that the books will be balanced this year, economists say.Thrown off course by the oil shock, Finance Minister Joe Oliver took the rare step last week of announcing the 2015 budget announcement will be put off from the usual February-March time slot until April at the earliest....This rate cut shows that the Bank of Canada believes the Canadian economy is facing more trouble than the Conservatives are admitting,.. NDP finance critic Nathan Cullen said.

109,0,"RBC, Canada's largest bank, is drawing flak about a planned increase in service charges starting June 1.While other Big Five banks have raised fees this year, RBC's changes will affect lower-income customers -  those who have accounts with low or no monthly fees and a limited number of transactions.Andrew Cash, federal NDP MP for Dovercourt, has started a petition asking Canadians to stop the expansion of ...pay-to-pay.. fees. This refers to a practice by some companies to charge customers a fee to pay their monthly bills.Back in 2012, Cash started a successful campaign to end $2 paper-bill fees by telecom providers. This led to a ban by Canada's telecom regulator on Jan. 1....Banks are charging you extra just to pay things with your own money,.. says the MP, who stood outside a bank on Bloor St. W. and Dovercourt Rd. on May 4 collecting signatures for the petition.RBC announced many service fees and account changes at the same time. One change, in particular, has attracted attention....Some debit transactions that didn't previously count as debit transactions will now count,.. said RBC spokesman Andrew Block.Customers who exceed their monthly limit of free debit transactions will pay a monthly fee of $1 to $2 for each RBC investment contribution and mortgage, loan or credit card payment they make from their accounts.They will also pay fees for Interac Flash (or tap) point-of-sale debit transactions, which didn't count against their monthly limit before.Some affected accounts have no monthly fees -  such as the Leo's Young Savers account, which has 15 free debit transactions, and the Student Banking account, which has 25 free debit transactions.Another affected account is Day to Day Banking, which has a $4 monthly fee. Starting June 1, these customers will get 12 free debit transactions a month (up from 10)....Most of the account packages we offer include unlimited transactions, so this change would not apply,.. Block pointed out. ...Also, 80 per cent of our clients either pay no monthly fee or receive a rebate on their monthly fee...Here are other changes RBC announced to clients:Seniors' rebates on eligible bank accounts will be restricted to clients aged 65 and over (up from 60-plus). The change will not affect those who already receive a senior's rebate.Overdraft protection will cost $4 a month plus overdraft interest (if used). Before, clients would pay either $4 a month or overdraft interest, whichever was higher.Stop payments done by phone or at branches will cost $20 each (up from $18).Rebates will increase on some accounts, such as VIP Banking and Signature No Limit, for clients who have multiple products with RBC.Business banking services, such as electronic deposits and credits, will go up to 75 cents (from 65 cents). Deposit account statements will be $3 each for paper statements with cheque image pages (up from $2).Pricing changes are always a sensitive issue for clients, said Block. He encouraged clients to call or visit their branch to ensure they have the banking options and advice that best met their needs.I can appreciate that interest rates are at historic lows, and aren't expected to rise sharply any time soon. And competition is fierce, especially with branchless banks and mortgage brokers offering access to non-bank providers.The Big Five banks have costly branch networks to support. Some have already made unpopular changes, such as TD's decision to stop protecting former Canada Trust customers from higher fees.However, banks should be fair and progressive in adjusting their service charges.Is it fair for RBC to collect interest on loan, mortgage and credit-card debt and then charge extra fees to clients making their loan, mortgage and credit card payments once they exceed their monthly debit limits?Is it progressive for RBC to give clients a large multi-product rebate if they also have mortgages, investments and credit cards with the bank?In addition, RBC will limit its multi-product rebates to clients with active credit cards (those with an annual fee or with at least one transaction in the past 90 days) and active investments (those with a minimum balance of $500 or a pre-authorized contribution plan set up to the investment account).Customers have choices. They can switch to banks or credit unions with lower fees, using the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada's account selector tool. But some don't want to bank online or go out of their way to visit a branch.In a climate of low interest rates, I hope the federal government will adopt new rules for pay-to-pay fees by banks as it had done so decisively with telecom providers.",18.33,6.85,3.05,3.81,14.34,10.41,6.09,2.41,4.82,0.51,5.2,4.82,0.13,0,0.25,0,1.27,0,0

111,0,"I gave my first university lecture in philosophy at the University of Ghana, Legon, when I was a freshly credentialed 21-year-old. My audience was a couple of hundred students gathered in a vast hall, with ceiling fans to move the hot and humid air. Above the murmur of the fans and the muttering of students, I tried to explain why Descartes thought the mere possibility that there was an Evil Demon deceiving their senses meant they couldn't know for sure that I was really there. Ah, Cartesian skepticism! I remember diagraming the structure of the argument in huge chalk letters on an enormous blackboard.After the class, a group of students, many of them older than I, followed me home across campus. Was I really worried, they wanted to know, that there might be such a powerful Evil Demon? What they didn't ask was why they had to listen to this bizarre argument made by a Frenchman three and a half centuries earlier. Yes, the material would be on the exam every student had to pass at the end of the first year. But why?The answer used to be easy: College is a place where you come to learn such things. But as higher education expands its reach, it's increasingly hard to say what college is like and what college is for. In the United States, where I now teach, more than 17 million undergraduates will be enrolling in classes this fall. They will be passing through institutions small and large, public and private, two-year and four-year, online and on campus. Some of them will be doing vocational courses -  in accounting or nursing or web design -  at for-profit institutions like DeVry University and the University of Phoenix. Many will be entering community colleges hoping to gain a useful qualification or to prepare themselves for a transfer to a four-year college. Others will be entering liberal-arts colleges without plans for a major, let alone a profession. On whatever track, quite a few will encounter Descartes as part of their undergraduate requirements. Why should that be? You'll be hard-pressed to find a consensus on such things. That's because two distinct visions of higher education contend throughout our classrooms and campuses.One vision focuses on how college can be useful -  to its graduates, to employers and to a globally competitive America. When presidential candidates talk about making college more affordable, they often mention those benefits, and they measure them largely in dollars and cents. How is it helping postgraduate earnings, or increasing G.D.P.? As college grows more expensive, plenty of people want to know whether they're getting a good return on their investment. They believe in Utility U.Another vision of college centers on what John Stuart Mill called ......experiments in living,'' aimed at getting students ready for life as free men and women. (This was not an entirely new thought: the ......liberal'' in ......liberal education'' comes from the Latin liberalis, which means ......befitting a free person.'') Here, college is about building your soul as much as your skills. Students want to think critically about the values that guide them, and they will inevitably want to test out their ideas and ideals in the campus community. (Though more and more students are taking degrees online, most undergraduates will be on campus a lot of the time.) College, in this view, is where you hone the tools for the foundational American project, the pursuit of happiness. Welcome to Utopia U.Together, these visions -  Utility and Utopia -  explain a great deal about modern colleges and universities. But taken singly, they lead to very different metrics for success.Consider the declining proportion of facÎulty with tenure. Tenured faculty are defined by more than the fact that they are hard to fire. Tenure allows professors to pursue intellectual projects without regard for what the trustees or the governor or the community care about. It gives them the kind of intellectual freedom that has helped make our universities the research powerhouses of the world. Adjunct faculty, on the other hand, are a lot less expensive -  they're paid less and typically lack health and other benefits -  and you can easily expand or contract their ranks as demand fluctuates. In the Utility vision, students are consumers; they have needs and desires to be met, at a price they'll pay. If pleasing the customer is the goal, a tenured faculty member who wants to teach what he or she considers worth teaching can be an inconvenience. Plus, at Utility U., one obvious way to better your ......value proposition'' is to cut costs. These days, three-quarters of the teaching faculty at America's nonprofit colleges and universities are hired as adjuncts with no tenure and no research support. A few decades ago, only a quarter were.At Utility U., the search for efficiency requires tools for evaluating teachers. Management, as the old saw has it, is measurement. Years ago, I was on a committee at a great university that looked into the system by which students evaluated courses. The most reliable predictor of whether students liked a course, it turned out, was their answer to the question ......Did the professor respect you?'' Customers like to be loved; attentive service makes for good Yelp reviews. But that's a very different question from, say: How, if at all, did you change through the class? What good, if any, did those changes do you? Did you learn to uncover the ideological or conceptual demons that may be flummoxing your good sense? Mr. Chips's encouraging smile has pedagogical value, but so, perhaps, does Professor Kingsfield's basilisk stare.If Utility U. is concerned with value, Utopia U. is concerned with values. The values agenda can involve the content of classes, the nature of campus communities or both. When I teach a seminar that deals with theories of identity and social justice, my aim is to provide tools of analysis so that students -  men and women of various ethnic, religious and sexual descriptions -  can sort through such issues by themselves. But class discussions aren't always abstract and impersonal: Everyone has identity allegiances and intuitions about justice. And the same is true for discussions elsewhere on campus. At Utopia U., the aim is to create a safe space, to check your privilege and suspend the prejudices of the larger world, to promote human development and advance moral progress.And so ......civility'' is on the agenda, ......safe'' spaces are spreading and microaggressions -  possibly unintentional slights that stem from racial, ethnic or sexual difference -  are to be scrutinized, sometimes through a jeweler's loupe. It's easy to roll your eyes at ......social justice warriors,'' but there's a perfectly good idea here: People don't think well when they feel personally insulted or aggrieved. And in classes, thinking well is the main objective. Buzzwords aside, a lot of this is just courtesy -  Emily Post by way of Foucault. Still, the Utopians can be reluctant to admit that there may be conflicts between expanding civility and deepening understanding, between the safe-space ideal and the free-speech ideal. (Not a few campus quarrels come down to: Who's silencing whom?) A culture of civility sometimes does make Neither Utility U. nor Utopia U. has the full run of any one campus. In the familiar caricature, there's the performance-studies major who is putting up fliers for the Naomi Klein talk, collecting signatures for the fossil-free petition and wondering whether the student alliance for gender equity is as racially inclusive as it claims. Then there's the engineering major, first in the family to go to college, traipsing across the quad with a discounted, two-editions-out-of-date version of the material-science textbook. All that identity stuff is a dimly perceived distraction in this student's light cone, readily tuned out. One student thinks ......bi-curious'' is a word; the other doesn't see why you would use molecular-orbital theory when valence bonding provides answers faster. The two students cross paths only physically. It's almost as if they're attending two different colleges.One reason this is a caricature is that people aren't always found on the expected side of the disciplinary (and class) divides. At liberal-arts campuses, certainly, almost everyone drinks from the fountain of human betterment, albeit some from a Dixie cup and others from a Big Gulp. And very few are completely unmindful of the getting-a-job thing that's rumored to follow graduation. But when you superimpose the two visions of college -  as a forcing house of virtue and as means for building human capital -  you inevitably get interference patterns, ripples and ridges of indignation and disquiet. That's what you're seeing when the safe-space ethic runs amok, as with students who claim offense when their ideas are challenged or who want to see ......trigger warnings'' on even canonical literature, like those cardboard lids on hotel-room glasses. Here, the student is at once the sensitive servant of high causes and a demanding customer.Nor are these tensions likely to resolve themselves, because higher education has to play so many roles. The truth is that colleges and universities do a tremendous amount that neither of these pictures captures -  that just can't be reduced to the well-being of their graduates. For one thing, the old ideal of knowledge for its own sake hasn't been extinguished. For another, universities are the homes of all kinds of public goods. They are, for example, the source of much of today's best research. Without them we would know much less than we do about the nature of the cosmos or the workings of the human brain or the ways of reading a novel. A flourishing literary culture is made possible not because institutions of higher learning create writers but because they prepare readers (and yes, it helps that they provide jobs for plenty of poets and novelists too). There's even something to be said, especially in a democracy, for an educated citizenry, able to question the creeds of the moment.Which brings us back to demons and doubt. Was there any point to studying such things? My first class of freshmen, all those years ago, certainly had reservations about Monsieur Descartes's method of systematic doubt. Once they were reassured about their instructor's sanity, though, they got into the spirit of things, and some, at least, came to see why epistemology -  the study of knowledge -  might be worthwhile. Maybe not practical .._ unless you were looking for a job as a professor. But interesting. Mind-expanding, even. Possibly, there was something to be said for the intellectual discipline of second-guessing what you thought was true. And that wasn't just good for them. Who would want to live in a nation of people without doubts?Like most of the students I've had since, they learned that what you can do and who you can be -  the qualities of your skills and of your soul -  are two separate questions that aren't quite separable. And that college was a pretty good place to work out some answers to both",17.96,10.22,5.14,5.08,14.65,13.73,7.03,4.38,4.92,0.92,5.3,5.62,0.32,0.16,0.59,0.05,1.19,0,0
112,0,"LOS ANGELES -  FOUR centuries after the pilgrims, families are still celebrating their successful arrival on North American shores with a big meal at the end of November. But the big roasted turkey doesn't always have the starring role.In the family of Margoth Abrego, a 56-year-old Salvadoran immigrant, the whole bird never makes it to the dinner table. Instead, two turkeys (one cooked in the oven, the other on the stovetop) are picked apart in the kitchen, then stuffed in bread to make a Salvadoran dish called pan con chumpe.The pan con chumpe is served alongside arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas), a traditional Puerto Rican dish. For the Abrego family, Thanksgiving is a celebration of their roots in distant places -  and a reminder of the long struggle to keep the family united. For 14 years, Ms. Abrego grew up in El Salvador without her mother, who had left to work in Los Angeles hotels and remarried into a Puerto Rican family....My mom can't talk about her childhood without crying,.. said Ms. Abrego's daughter, Leisy Abrego, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ...She's still trying to make up for all those years she lost with her mother...PhotoA ""traditional"" Thanksgiving dinner.

In an age when America's borders are harder to cross than ever, not every immigrant family is so fortunate.Thanksgiving, we're told in school, began as an encounter between cultures. Abraham Lincoln formalized it as a national celebration during the Civil War, seeking to bind together a divided and wounded people. Today, with ample apologies to our Native American friends, the fourth Thursday in November is our most widely embraced and beloved gathering.American airports do not fill to the brim on July 3 with people trying to make it home in time for Fourth of July barbecues. Christmas is a religious holiday. But Thanksgiving goes well with a prayer from any faith, and is now enjoyed with an increasingly multiethnic cuisine. It's a celebration of the force that binds our diverse country together: family.You can easily find recipes for Bengali Thanksgiving feasts, Chinese turkey steamed buns and accounts of Armenian family Thanksgiving reunions.

113,0,"Many parents struggle to persuade their school-aged children to take to heart the value of eating a healthy, varied diet, one that is colorful, full of vegetables and fruits and light on the bland, refined white grains like bread, pasta and pizza that go down so easily with children. Marlo and Corey, parents of Brooke, 10, and Hunter, 7, want the whole family to sit down to eat one, balanced meal together, but Brooke refuses to eat many foods, preferring pasta with butter and cheese or ramen noodles. Her younger brother almost always follows her lead, and Marlo and Corey have been willing to prepare something different for each child just to be sure that they eat enough.Marlo and Corey hope to change that pattern, so they, along with Brooke, a sixth grader, and Hunter, a third grader, have agreed to participate in the Picky Eater Project. We (the authors Sally Sampson, founder and editor of the nonprofit children..È cooking magazine Chop Chop and Natalie Digate Muth, a practicing pediatrician and registered dietitian) will coach the whole family. Our hope, and our plan, is that helping the parents to change their approach, encouraging the family to cook together, and adjusting routines can help transform family meals and the children..È food preferences without loading on extra cost, time or family battles.We started by interviewing the whole family to better understand the children..È food preferences as well as identify opportunities for them to willingly, of their own volition, try new foods. Our first suggestion came as a bit of a (pleasant) surprise to Marlo and Corey; they invited family friends over for dinner. Marlo and Corey made the main course; their guests arrived with some interesting appetizers.Marlo and Corey prepared steak, rice and Caprese, a tomato and mozzarella salad, which they did not expect the children to eat. Their neighbors brought steamed mussels and a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, among them artichoke leaves, green grapes, oranges, spicy green peppers, carrots, heirloom tomatoes and grape tomatoes. The children had just gotten home from swimming practice and were very hungry. The timing was somewhat strategic, as hungry kids as well as adults, are generally more willing to eat whatever is placed in front of them.Simply tasting a new food helps to ...train the taste buds... It can take 15 to 20 tries, but eventually a previously rejected taste can become more acceptable, and even preferred. We had coached Marlo and Corey not to make a big deal about new foods ... specifically, not to force or even urge the children to try any of them. We want to nudge the children to try something without pressuring them, which actually sets off a counterproductive response ... ...if they are selling it so hard, it must be gross... We do not subscribe to the ...you have to take just one bite.. school of thought. The parents..Èjob is to offer a variety of foods: The children..È job is to decide if they want to eat those foods or not.The youngest friend turned out to have a very adventurous palate. As soon as the food was set out she propped herself at the kitchen table and started snacking on the mussels, carrots and tomatoes, and even took a bite of the spicy pepper. At first, the older children didn..È notice. Hunter started trolling through the pantry looking for bread, and Marlo gently redirected him to choose from the foods that were available in the kitchen as ...appetizers... Hunter was hungry, so he ate. He went for the green grapes but also tried a grape tomato and carrots, both of which he liked.After noticing his friend eating the mussels, his parents told us later, Hunter seemed intrigued. He kept walking by and eyeing them. He said he was afraid to eat the mussels because they might make him throw up. He started sniffing them. He then went to Corey and asked him what he thought about ...that weird-looking food over there. What is it made of?.. He dared Brooke to try one but she refused. ...Gross... He asked Corey to ...please come over and look at this thing. What does it taste like?.. He picked one up and smelled it. Then he licked it.Marlo says that during this whole scenario, she was biting her tongue and pretending not to notice, stopped herself from cajoling Hunter into trying a mussel. She couldn..È believe what happened next: Hunter took the mussel out of the shell and popped it in his mouth. Chewed. Swallowed. And then said that it was delicious and he really liked it.Brooke tried one too, as did the other, older visiting child. Brooke said that it was actually pretty good, but that it ...tasted odd. It has the texture of bubble gum but I like how salty it tasted... But one was enough for her. Hunter ate several more and at the end of the night declared mussels to be his new favorite food.As everyone sat down for dinner, Marlo and Corey implemented the one-meal rule. Brooke and Hunter would not be getting a separate meal tonight. They didn..È pay much attention because they were busy chatting and eating their favorite parts of the dinner with their friends (mostly the steak and white rice). They didn..È eat or even try everything on their plates, and that was O.K.Marlo and Corey thought that the meal was a big success. Clearly, watching a friend casually eat foods that seemed unfamiliar had more of an influence than their encouragement (although they hope this newfound willingness to try a new food would carry over into their own regular family meals). They also acknowledged that it was difficult not to pressure the children to just take one bite. Both still believed that had the outcome been different ... if the children had not tried any of the foods and did not eat the dinner ... they would have defaulted to their old routine of making the children their own separate meal without thinking twice about it, because they cannot stomach the idea of sending them to bed hungry.This week, we asked Marlo and Corey to do the following:1. Agree on a plan. We suggest choosing one or two of the following ...kitchen rules.. and really sticking to them. Our suggestions (from last week..È Picky-Free Parenting Rules):We will only eat in the kitchen. We will not walk around the house with snacks and drinks. We will not eat dinner in the living room in front of the TV or computer. We may occasionally ...break.. this rule, but very infrequently.We will eat family meals together whenever possible. You don..È have to eat everything, or anything if you don..È want to, but we will all sit down together at the same time to share a meal.When we eat, we will be mindful and not have distractions, like television and phones. The rule applies to all of us.We will not make separate meals. As the parent, I will decide what food is offered. I will take into consideration preferences of other family members. As kids, you can decide what you want to eat of what I offer you, and how much, but I will not be making other meals. If you do not want to eat now, then you may have a fruit or vegetable as a snack later. But that is it.Snacks will occur at certain predetermined times. We will not graze all day.2. Transform the fridge Nudge your family towards healthier choices by storing the healthy foods front and center, and the less healthy foods, or the preferred foods you wish your child would eat less of, in harder to see places. Here..È how:..¢Put the not-so-healthy items in the back of the refrigerator. This way, you and your family will have to work a little bit to find and eat them. That one extra step will go a long way in those foods being eaten less frequently...¢Put the fruits and vegetables on the main shelves, front and center in the refrigerator. We have all had healthy produce go bad because it we forgot about it in a fruit and vegetable drawer. If you put them in a location that can..È be missed you and the family will be more likely to eat them. If you prep the healthy stuff, it is more likely to be eaten. Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables and cut them into snack-sized pieces. Put them in clear containers so they won..È be missed...¢Place leftovers and food that needs to be eaten soon in an easy-to-find location. Plan to use leftovers for lunches and snacks. For example, use leftover chicken in salads and sandwiches instead of pre-packaged and not-so-healthy (due to high sodium and nitrites) deli meat.3. Transform the pantry The food available in your pantry can make or break your picky eater project. You will eat much healthier by default when you stock your pantry in a way that makes eating a variety of healthful foods easy. Here..È how:..¢Throw away all outdated food and any packaged food that contains any variation of sugar as the first or second ingredient. Do the same with the high-sodium products. Does a single serving of chips provide more than half of your child..È recommended sodium level? Toss it. It is O.K. to hold on to items that you can..È toss because you need to use them occasionally (say brown sugar or granulated sugar) or foods that you just aren..È ready to part with, but when you restock the pantry, store them in harder-to-see and reach places...¢Now, restock with just the good stuff. A good snack is a whole food, like fruits or vegetables (fresh, frozen, dried, canned or baked), whole grains, nuts or seeds, whole-grain crackers, cheese, plain yogurt or eggs. To evaluate packaged snacks, look for foods with less than 15 percent of calories from saturated fat, no trans fat, less than 210 milligrams of sodium and no more than 13 grams of added sugars per serving.We asked Brooke and Hunter to do the following:1. Together with your parents, come up with one new breakfast you..Èl eat this week. Try to choose a breakfast that includes grains (ideally whole grains), protein (like egg, meat, nuts or seeds), a fruit or vegetable and dairy (like milk, yogurt or cheese). We suggested recipes: Double Corn Pancakes, Frittata orYogurt Parfait2. Try one new food that you..Èe never had before.3. Make one or more of these great tasting snacks: Energy bars, Fruit kabobs.4. Make a dinner that is customizable, like Fish Tacos.Stay tuned for next week to check in on how it goes.",16.49,12.02,7.44,4.58,12.9,15.33,8.77,3.53,6.28,0.83,6.01,5.73,0.44,0.11,0.17,0,1.1,1,0

In years past, deer have eaten every hosta and tulip in sight, wild turkeys have chased homeowners off their lawns, bears have ripped apart bird feeders like tin cans.This year, it is the coyote.In New York City, where Eastern coyotes are having a breakout year, a glimpse of one of the animals is still rare enough to elicit curious amazement. But in the suburbs, the feeling is different.In New Castle, N.Y., residents are warring over what to do about the animals, which attacked and killed a number of small dogs in the town this past year.

Soon, the town was being attacked on social media for waging ...coyote jihad...In the end, Mr. Greenstein had the police chief and the town..È environmental coordinator distill the two sets of recommendations and devise a coyote response plan, which was made final this month. It lays out steps for the local police to follow, depending on the situation. For nonaggressive encounters, the police will, if asked, provide information on how to prevent human-coyote conflict. But if a coyote attacks an attended pet, the episode will be noted on an online map and the police may take steps to remove the wild animal....We found that each side was so passionate about the issue that it was better for us to come up with a reasonable compromise,.. said Mr. Greenstein, who is now being challenged for his town supervisor seat by the chairwoman of the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, the more pro-coyote group.Jim Horton, a licensed trapper in Westchester County, said that he had trapped a dozen coyotes in the past year, but that in ...99 percent of the calls I get for coyotes, I talk the people out of trapping... He added: ...Coyotes are here.

116,0,"My daughter has a four-year-old dog that will not consistently come when called. In our yard, he comes to me. When out with other dogs in the green space, it seems like he deliberately runs away. At the dog park, he will not come until he has played for a few minutes. How can I get him to come reliably?It is not surprising that many dogs choose play over coming when called. We make similar decisions. We grumble if disturbed during a good hockey game or favourite television show. Children show obvious dejection and dawdle when asked to leave a party. We all want to prolong the fun.Dogs are no different. During play, there is a cost to coming when called: The fun stops. If we are not careful, the word ...come.. can start to mean it's time to leave. That is not positive for social creatures.Treats might not trump play but there are ways to get past this.If the dog has learned that ...come,.. means run, choose a new word like ...here.. and start over. Make every effort to ensure this word leads to positive experiences. Use special treats, fun, games and anything else that is good in your dog's world. Be generous to a fault at this stage.Next, drill various distractions in controlled environments. Too many people jump from easy recalls to the dog park without intermediary steps. That is like going from kindergarten to university. The leap in skill level is too great. Many dogs cannot come away from a piece of food. It is no wonder they will not come when called when playing with another dog.One clever drill is to put food in a bowl, then place a colander over the bowl and tape the two pieces together. The dog will be able to see and smell the food but not reach it. Practise calling your dog away from this tempting distraction. Use a leash or long line to prevent the dog from grabbing the bowl and dashing off. If the dog is at the right grade level, they might hesitate, but they should listen.Finally, if you cannot beat them, join them. Use activities that your dog loves as a reward. If a dog likes sniffing trees for pee-mail, call them away from a tree. Reward them with a treat and then send them back to sniff some more. The dog learns that ...here.. is not the end of their fun, but an opportunity to earn more free time. Carry this lesson up through to the dog park. Use more free play as a reward for coming away from other dogs during play.Do give a little bit of leeway. Sometimes our dogs feel trapped by other dogs in their space. They might need a moment to diffuse a situation before obeying.Our dog confuses sit with down. When we say sit, he bounces between sitting and lying down. How do we get him to be more accurate?Part of training a dog to understand a command involves drilling for clarity. This means that sit means sit and down means down. The term used by trainers is stimulus control.Play training games. Ask them to perform skills they know. Only reward responses that are correct the first time. Do not reward incorrect responses.This teaches dogs to focus more carefully on the words and to associate them with the correct actions. Make sure to teach stay as well. Some dogs take silence as an indication they were wrong. Stay helps them learn to hold position firmly when correct.",11.17,10.95,6.47,4.48,15.09,18.41,6.63,3.48,5.14,0.83,8.62,2.99,0.17,0,0.33,0,1.33,0,0
117,0,"With all of the information available on the subject, it's surprising that some drivers remain unconvinced that winter tires are safer than all-season tires.In most driving situations, winter tires outperform all-season tires on cold surfaces and in winter conditions. Transport Canada supports this view, based on a study that revealed all-season tires are less effective when temperatures drop below -10 Celsius.Tests conducted by Transport Canada and the Canadian Rubber Association revealed that all-season tires veered off the testing track at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h; this wasn't a problem with cars with winter tires.Unlike winter tires, all-season tires don't have the cold weather compounds, tread swipes and channeling tread patterns for traction in deep snow. And although most new vehicles are designed with front-wheel drivetrain, all four tires should be replaced. All tires require linear (forward) traction and lateral (sideways) traction in order to prevent loss of control.In parts of northern Ontario, the Highways Traffic Act allows the limited use of studded tires between October 1st and April 30th. According to a Government of Ontario website, a study has shown that ""studded tires are more effective than other tires under icy conditions, particularly on wet ice.""To further persuade drivers to install winter tires, last week the Ontario provincial government announced a plan to help lower auto insurance rates by requiring insurance companies to provide a discount for those drivers who purchase and install winter tires, starting January 1, 2016.Once you have decided to equip your vehicle with winter tires, here are some tips that will make for safer driving this winter.1. Install four tires, not two. Transport Canada recommends installing four in order to improve vehicle handling. In short, four tires will optimize the ABS and electronic stability systems.2. Install winter tires sooner, rather than later, to avoid the rush at service departments after the first snowfall.3. Winter tires should be removed when the daily average temperature is above 5 C and there is no more risk of snow or frost. Plus, winter tires are not as effective at stopping on dry and wet roads during the summer months.4. Consider purchasing a separate set of winter-only wheels. Winter wheels provide more flexibility in terms of tire widths - winter tires tend to perform better in narrow sizes and are better at moving through packed snow.5. Your local new car dealership offers a full selection of winter tires for most makes and models. Don't assume that independent auto retailers are cheaper; dealers buy winter tires in bulk during the summer to be competitive on price, and those tires are in stock now and will sell out fast. Some auto manufacturers are now offering no-charge winter tire packages on top of competitive rebates and finance rates.6. Ensure that your tires are properly inflated. Tire pressures will decrease as temperatures drop, and checking the inflation once a month is recommended.7. Store your tires properly. Improper tire storage can lead to damage and can shorten the lifespan of your tires. Many dealerships offer tire storage services at a modest cost.So, with winter approaching, consider the safety aspect of winter tires. Don't compromise your safety and the safety of your loved ones by driving a vehicle that's less safe than it could be.If you are interested in a career in the automotive industry, the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association is hosting three Job & Career Information Fairs throughout Ontario this fall.

She arrived in Calgary as a three-year-old with her immigrant parents, who were fleeing South Africa for a brighter future in Canada....My father and mother wanted us to have a better place to live,.. she says. ...But we were the typical immigrant family, with five dollars in our pocket. Growing up, we had very little...That upbringing has influenced Dickinson..È attitudes toward money, the trappings of material wealth and the things she is trying to pass along to her five grandchildren.Dickinson left the Den in January after eight seasons, and now shuttles between Calgary, Toronto and a cottage in Collingwood. She runs marketing communications firm Venture Communications, and as a result of her Dragon..È Den experience launched YouInc., which invests in and encourages entrepreneurs.I asked her about a mistake that taught a memorable lesson and what advice she has for her grandchildren.Your money mistake is connected to flowers. Can you explain?Growing up, we had very little, and so buying flowers was an extravagance. I have always loved them, and when I first became successful, I started buying flowers every week for my home. It was something that illustrated to me my success.But after a while, I asked myself: Why are you doing this every week? The proof of your success should not be in the things you acquire. It should be that your success gives you the ability to do what you want.So I stopped buying them every week. Flowers are wonderful and I still buy them, but because I love them, not because they prove something.What is your biggest lesson?When I was younger, I thought success showed up in certain ways ... the home you had, the car you drove, the jewelry you wore, etc. The lesson as I have gotten older ... and hopefully wiser ... is that material trappings are just that. They trap some of your money and are not what..È important.My grandma taught me to love people and like things. She..È right. It..È not about accumulating things with your money, but accumulating memories. That doesn..È mean you can..È have nice stuff, you just don..È need a lot of it.What common mistakes do you see?People start out with good intentions to save, but get distracted and spend money on the wrong things. Then they get discouraged. It..È like weight loss. You just have to keep at it.What else do you see?Many people are afraid to seek advice. They..Èe afraid to admit they don..È have all the answers and so they end up spending money on the wrong things. A good place to start is your bank.What advice do you give to your grandchildren?Take 10 per cent of your allowance, or birthday money, and put it away. As you get older, give another 10 per cent of what you make to charity. Live on the rest.My oldest grandson is 14 and he learned a good lesson recently. He..È just finished Grade 8 and received some money as gifts. He told me he really wanted an Apple Watch and if he saved 10 per cent of the money he had been given he wouldn..È be able to afford it.He bought the watch. Two weeks later he told me he regretted it. It was cool, but not really worth the big price tag. He said he..È be more careful next time. It was a good lesson.The other lesson he..È learned is about how small things add up. We have a deal that he can have all the change he can find in the bottom of my purse. We put it away. At the end of the year he had $600. Even I thought: Holy Cow!Any concluding thoughts?Good money management starts with education. You can..È manage what you don..È understand, so become literate about financial matters. Learning the language of money management is a critical lesson for all ages.

And sometimes, they may use sharp comments to break through to us, stimulate thinking on the court and bring up the intensity level...Others are quoted as having an ambivalent relationship with Hyde-Lay ... respecting his knowledge as a coach but questioning his aggressive style.In video footage, Hyde-Lay can often be seen on the sidelines screaming, cursing and sometimes bowing his head and pulling at his hair....The (coach) who is in my face yelling at me and pulling my jersey closer to him is a teacher and is in a position of power over me,.. says Fraser-Brown, who has suffered panic attacks, nightmares, sleepwalking and anxiety....The coaches were emotionally abusive to a lot of talented young (athletes), who were destroyed by it...Fraser-Brown..È mother, Jennifer Fraser, at the time a teacher at the school, gathered testimonies at the request of school headmaster Bob Snowden.These testimonies contain allegations of aggressive verbal denigration, profanity and scenes of public humiliation during practices, where coaches would call players to stand in front of them while they screamed criticisms at them.In some cases, students were grabbed and held in place, according to the testimonies....These are students who don..È even know each other and they were telling exactly the same story practically,.. she says. ...Year after year after year this is happening...During one game, Fraser and her husband witnessed their son, who had made a mistake on the court, being grabbed by the jersey by coach Reagan Daly, who held him to his face and screamed, she says.......Don..È walk away from me when I..È f---ing talking to you,..È. Fraser recalls the coach yelling. ...All the parents heard it.

If a group of athletes have gotten to the point of launching a formal complaint, there is a good reason for it and I am deeply concerned and dismayed that Mr. Sanderson completely minimized and explained away their complaints of emotional abuse...Sanderson declined to be interviewed for this story. In a written statement, he said: ...My report was based solely on the facts given to me by the athletes themselves in lengthy and private interviews with each of them .._ I am confident in the accuracy of my report...One of the dozen players who provided testimony and says she suffered on the girls team calls Sanderson..È findings offensive....I..Èe had the toughest of tough coaches and I think there..È nothing wrong with that,.. says the athlete, who now attends university in Ontario and asked not to be identified for fear that speaking out could compromise her acceptance into an academic program. ...I can see the difference between that and being tormented.

152,1,"GENEVA- Explaining that simply identifying the phenomena can significantly reduce the risk of early mortality, the World Health Organization released a study Wednesday revealing that the vast majority of deaths worldwide are caused by a failure to heed omens.Researchers, who analyzed worldwide mortality data from 1980 to 2014, reportedly discovered that disregarding ominous signs, portentous dreams, and other harbingers of darkness accounted for over 38 million deaths each year. According to the study, failing to take notice of prophetic signs of one's end was the largest contributing factor to fatalities in every geographic region and socioeconomic demographic....We've found that as many as 95 percent of people who've witnessed dark portents could have survived if they had taken the simple step of paying attention to the forewarnings of their impending doom and acted accordingly,.. said WHO coordinator for public health Dr. Alex Kazberouk while presenting images of spilled salt, a white moth attempting to enter a home, six crows, and other commonly dismissed omens. ...Prompt recognition of a presage is crucial. Individuals can greatly increase their life expectancy by responding with prayers and sacrifices or exposing the source of the omen to strip away its power......Unfortunately, regardless of age, sex, or race, those who clearly see signs of their looming demise often neglect to take basic precautions, such as wearing a necklace of amber or carrying an acorn,.. Kazberouk added....If we've learned anything from our analysis of global mortality statistics, it's that as soon as a wizened old hag visits your doorstep in the dead of night, you need to immediately kill and bury a bird, then recite a hymn over a goblet filled with polished pebbles...An analysis of health records revealed that of the 2.5 million individuals who died in the United States last year, a full 50 percent reportedly saw a woman in white, a raven with a broken neck in the middle of a footpath, or other augury at some point in their lives. In addition, roughly a quarter of the deceased had reportedly dreamed about multiple moons, drowning in mud, or a thorny tree sprouting from their heart, yet took no preventative action upon waking.WHO officials told reporters that properly identifying a portent of death and immediately visiting a local shaman dramatically reduced the impact of omens, especially if individuals combined the practice with regularly ringing a bell to ward off evil spirits.The study also confirmed that even after experiencing an unmistakable and foreboding premonition, such as an owl appearing in the daylight, nine out of every 10 people failed to carry out even the most routine measures to subdue the unhallowed forces surrounding them by burning a tin of sage and sweetgrass in the center of a room in which they eat and drink....If we've learned anything from our analysis of global mortality statistics, it's that as soon as a wizened old hag visits your doorstep in the dead of night, you need to immediately kill and bury a bird, then recite a hymn over a goblet filled with polished pebbles,.. National Institute of Health director Francis Collins told reporters, adding that younger men in particular shouldn't take their safety for granted if the crone suddenly disappears into the fog of night. ...In the morning, go back and sprinkle smoldering ashes on the bird's gravesite, then stomp three times with bare feet to vanquish fire with flesh......Everyone sees the omens, but how you react will make all the difference,.. Collins added. ...You can live a long, healthy life in the presence of these omens if you just take the necessary steps and incant the names of the four directions every day...Researchers were careful to note that as with all studies on mortality, there are notable exceptions to the rules, such as the rare case of a 104-year-old Japanese woman who has dreamed of her skin peeling away every year since 1950, yet has refused to rub a brown egg on her body.

The executive then marveled at how his small, independent operation had since grown into a $3 billion detention-services firm with offerings that expand beyond criminal incarceration to encompass the confinement of juvenile offenders, the mentally ill, and migrants awaiting deportation....I'd say we've come a long way since those crazy early days,.. said Parks, chuckling at the thought of the multiple loans he took out to finance the initial 1,300-square-foot facility and the long hours he put in trying to get the company's name out to various states' departments of corrections. ...When we opened for business, all we had was two or three part-time guards for the whole place- that's it. We didn't even have a watchtower at first, just a guy on the roof who sat in a folding chair with a rifle on his lap. Hard to believe, but that's how we got our start......If you'd told me back then- back when we had only one basketball hoop in the yard and barely enough money to keep the surveillance cameras on- that one day we'd have 80,000 beds at 60 facilities in 22 states, I'd have called you nuts,.. he continued.According to Parks, it was ...all hands on deck.. the first few years, and for a time, he handled the intake of each prisoner personally, filling out all the necessary forms and overseeing the filing system, and even stepping in on occasion to act as the facility's cook to provide the inmates with their three square meals a day. In those days, he said, the cell HCG used for solitary confinement doubled as its office supply closet. Now, his employees work in more roomy environs, with the company's 40-person in-house lobbying division occupying an entire floor of a modern office complex.Parks confirmed that for much of its first decade in business, the company might go weeks, or even months, without securing a no-bid contract to ship in prisoners from out of state. But in 1995, after a handful of well-placed campaign contributions and a concerted effort to help pass tough ...three strikes.. sentencing laws in state legislatures, HCG was reportedly able to break ground on its first of many full-size maximum-security prisons....There were times early on when I'd walk down the hall, pass only three or four inmates, and think, ...How are we going to make it to the end of the month?'.. said Parks, recalling several periods in which the company ...hemorrhaged money.. due to low recidivism, the result of occasional public investment in criminal rehabilitation programs. ...Compare that to now, though, when all of our prisons are filled to the gills and we're housing the overflow on bunks in the gymnasiums......And what's more, we're hiring them all out as manual labor at pennies on the dollar,.. he added. ...Talk about a success story...Parks confided that in the days before mandatory minimum sentences became widespread, the only thing that kept HCG in business was the occasional prison riot, which resulted in more time being added to inmates' sentences, helping to ensure more of the company's cells stayed occupied and bolstering its revenue.Nowadays, he explained, his business is so successful that it can pick and choose whom it imprisons, turning away difficult criminals who are more costly to house....Sure, it was touch and go for a while,.. said Parks, admitting he used to second-guess whether it would ever be possible ...to break even at this game... ...But that just makes it all the sweeter now that we've come out the other side and can now call ourselves an industry leader......At this rate, we're going to have 40 additional facilities in the United States by 2025,.. he added. ...And we've got plans for more on the way...",28.84,10.82,5.96,4.85,16.09,10.96,5.83,5.27,4.72,0.69,3.33,7.07,0,0,0.14,0,4.58,0,1

203,1,"BERKELEY, CA- With not a single scientist having successfully observed the behavior despite extensive ongoing research, the field of biology has made no progress in its understanding of how birds have sex, experts at the University of California told reporters Wednesday.Through 2,500 years of recorded natural history, hundreds of thousands of hours of fieldwork, and the testing of innumerable hypotheses in regard to the mechanism by which avifauna reproduce, not one instance of bird sex has been reliably documented, photographed, or described, according to the biologists....We've spent considerable time and effort attempting to unravel the mystery of sex among bird populations, but unfortunately it remains one of the great unanswered questions in our field,.. said ornithologist Daniel Abramson, who added that he has studied hundreds of bird species in habitats all across the globe, spending the bulk of his 28-year career staring through binoculars and crouched behind blinds in fruitless attempts to catch them in the act. ...We can say for certain that eggs emerge from some part of a bird's anatomy, and we know baby birds hatch from those eggs. But beyond that, we honestly have no idea how it works......We haven't ruled out the possibility that the feathers may in fact be the genitals......Do they secrete something onto each other's feathers and absorb it through their skin?.. he continued. ...Do they fly very high and have sex so far up in the sky that we're unable to observe it? At this point, no one can say for sure...Abramson's colleagues echoed his frustration and enumerated the vast array of theories currently being considered. These include the idea that male birds may be fertilizing the eggs in some way after they've been laid, as well as the hypothesis that all birds are females that produce clones of themselves. While unable to elaborate any further, the biologists also put forth the possibility that flying in a V formation or perhaps ...that thing on turkeys' necks.. has something to do with the process.A number of experts also reportedly subscribe to the notion that birds are one gender of an entire class of organisms, and bats are the other, complementary, gender....Most bird observations occur during the day, but it's possible that birds are having sex in the middle of the night when it's very dark and they're hard to see, or maybe inside clouds where we can't glimpse them at all- or maybe it occurs both in clouds and at night,.. said animal physiologist James Bosley, a proponent of the theory that currently has the most traction among biologists, which suggests that most birds reproduce by flying directly into each other at high speeds. ...My own research team is currently looking into whether ducks are doing it under water each time they dip beneath the surface, out of our view......Before that, we looked very carefully at birds that get close to each other and start flapping their wings around a bunch, but it turns out that in those instances they're usually just pecking at the same piece of food,.. he added.Bosley went on to state that for years, scientists had assumed migratory birds only engaged in sexual intercourse after flying south for the winter, a theory that was later abandoned after a group of North American ornithologists traveled to a conference at the University of S.£o Paulo and met Brazilian colleagues who had long believed the exact opposite to be true....At this point, we're not even sure if birds have genitals,.. said Felicia Lopez, a comparative anatomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...We've searched all over their bodies, but there are a lot of feathers down where you would expect something to be, and it makes it pretty hard to see anything.

The rating will also reportedly serve as a warning of the potentially disorienting effects associated with having to remember characters' names for as many as two hours and the discomfort that can occur when one is forced to keep track of narrative arcs for an entire film....It's simply a value-neutral designation intended to protect consumers, ensuring that they are fully informed about a movie and are able to make their own decisions about how much artistic and narrative originality they are comfortable seeing......We recognize how distressing it can be when viewers go into a film and suddenly find themselves confronted with jarring scenes containing a protagonist they've never encountered before, which is precisely why we created this rating,.. said Joan Graves, head of the MPAA's ratings board, who said the new category was added in part due to the thousands of complaints the organization has received from moviegoers who were upset they weren't given advance notice that they'd have to make sense of the scenarios unfolding onscreen. ...It's important that today's movie fans are aware upon entering the theater that none of what they will see has been adapted from a well-known comic book, television series, novel, video game, historical event, previous movie, or theme park ride......Ultimately, it will be up to the consumer's discretion as to whether a film is suitable for themselves and their family, but the O rating will explicitly caution people that they will have to pay attention during the movie and follow the storyline on their own,.. Graves added.Though sources said films requiring the new rating are comparatively rare, a spate of high-profile movies over the past several years that do not stem from any previously existing source material- including The Kids Are All Right, Her, WALL-E, Birdman, and Nebraska, among others- have left many viewers angered and perplexed. Citing test audiences they have observed, MPAA officials said that many moviegoers spent the entirety of such films in a state of distress, waiting for the moment when the Incredible Hulk, Katniss Everdeen, Wolverine, or another recognizable character from an established franchise would appear onscreen and clarify the meaning and direction of the film....I never would have gone to see Sicario if I knew it was going to be so unbearable,.. said filmgoer Mark Kemmer of Cleveland, referring to the recently released crime thriller set against the violent backdrop of the contemporary Mexican drug trade that, under the MPAA's guidelines, would receive the new rating. ...It was pretty much unwatchable.

260,1,"I made it.Crazy. One of my lamest attempts to leave the office early during my tenure as marketing specialist at DFJ Engineering, and not one person asked me where I was headed so soon.How could I possibly go for after-work drinks with my cubicle-mates on a night like this? I have leftover chili and a growler of Green Flash in the fridge, and a brand-new pair of super-cozy terrycloth sweatpants waiting on my dresser at home.This is the fourth Friday in a row I've skipped out on happy hour. I'm running out of excuses. Last week I said I had to give my cat some important cat medicine. The time before that I said I needed to take her to the vet for a teeth cleaning. If I flake out again, I might have to actually get a cat.So I better make tonight count by doing absolutely nothing.The key to brushing off your coworkers is to build your alibi early in the week. On Wednesday, let it slip that your cousin might be coming to town on the weekend. At lunch on Thursday, mention that you have to pick her up at the airport on Friday because she can't figure out public transit.A lot of people will tell you that the best approach is simply to be honest and say you want to hang out with your wife at home tonight eating leftovers and binge-watching TV in your new sweatpants, but if you get an annoying co-worker who says you can do that any night of the week, and he won't take no for an answer, you might end up at a bowling alley until 8 p.m., and that's worse than work.Here's what you do. When you arrive at the office on Friday morning, remind people that you have to pick up your cousin in the evening. Then, at 4:15, get up from your computer as if you're going to the restroom. But instead, head to the back storage nook by the testing lab, grab your messenger bag and coat -  which you stashed there earlier -  and slip out the west fire exit. If anyone asks where you're headed, just yell, ...Coffee run!.. and keep walking.Then head up Georgia Street and catch the SkyTrain to City Hall Station, where you take a bus to your condo. It's comical and a little melodramatic when you think about it, but then, so is season three of Orange is the New Black.Weekends move pretty fast. If you don't stop and do nothing for at least one of the evenings, you'll blink and it's Sunday afternoon, and you have that dreaded feeling that Monday is just around the corner, and you didn't even have a single two-hour nap.I do have a cousin coming to visit; that is happening IRL. But she is really good with public transit, and she's staying with a friend of hers. They're going to a party tonight with people my wife and I don't know. My cousin's an extrovert. I'm not an extrovert, I don't plan on becoming an extrovert, so why would I go to a party with a bunch of people I've never met? They could be the sweetest, most board-gaming cinephiles in the Pacific Northwest, but it still wouldn't change the fact that I prefer to drink my own martinis....I'm dancing on my own, I make the moves up as I go, and that's what they don't know, mmm hmmm, that's what they don't know- ..It's not like I would label myself an introvert, or any ...vert.. for that matter.

A person cannot choose how outgoing he is, but he can choose what type of gin he uses.I quote Geddy Lee: ...If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice...Good point there.

After all, Luke is able to fix his lightsaber without contacting the Jedi Help Desk or making an appointment with a Jedi Genius.But back on earth, the Force is not strong with our technology. The hype is often better than the reality, especially at the initial launch. Think I'm overstating it?

Finding a place to stay would be easy, thanks to Spacebnb. The Clone Army would be comprised of PC clones from dimly-remembered, vaguely warlike brands like Commodore, Apollo and Data General.R2-D2 and C-3PO would glitch out at key moments, with Luke constantly having to reboot them ( and wait 30 minutes before they're fully operational.To keep R2-D2, C-3PO and his lightsaber powered up, Luke would carry different chargers and cables for each, making his carry-on bag his most important accessory.Lightsabers would have 55 minutes of fight time, 24 hours of wait time.No matter what he had been through with them, Luke would trade in the 30-year-old R2-D2 and C-3PO to get next-generation droids, the ones with better cameras and cooler apps.Han must reset his password to the Millennium Falcon either every 30 days or whenever someone says, ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" ( whichever comes first. The Millennium Falcon's Navi-Computer might get them to their destination but not always via the quickest, most direct route. And vocal commands to its onboard computer would be misunderstood. Constantly. The Millennium Falcon and all podracers come equipped with plenty of cup holders plus back-up cameras to make parking easier.Instead of risking squadrons of X-Wing fighters in an attack on the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance could just send a virus to attack the B2E (Business-to-Empire) software running the thermal exhaust port. Or it might just crash on its own.After being awarded medals by Princess Leia for (spoiler alert) destroying the First Death Star, Generals Solo and Skywalker would snap a selfie and post it on Tweet Tweet (named after the sound R2-D2 makes).Instead of the love interest triangle of Leia, Han, and Luke, Luke would join J-Date-Jedi-Date (""Use The Force To Get Chosen"").Everyone in the Empire would know Darth Vader is Luke's dad after he liked him on Spacebook.No one would look up from their screens. Ever. When told that Han and Leia finally have disabled the force field that protected the Second Death Star, the awaiting rebel pirates, busy playing Candy Crush, would ask for ""another five minutes to finish this round.""Of all Star Wars' superior technology, the most important breakthrough for us to develop is not what you might think.

279,1,"When 53-year-old Denise Hobson first heard about the standard animal agriculture practice of ""forced molting,"" by which female chickens are deprived of food and light for up to two weeks in order to artificially jolt their weary bodies into producing more eggs, she was at first appalled - and then inspired to try it herself, to boost her own chances of getting pregnant.Denise, a single woman living in New York City, explained that she has been trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant since the age of 49. As a perimenopausal woman, she was all too aware that her ovulation was becoming increasingly sporadic and that her body was producing fewer and fewer eggs. However, she figured that she would compensate for her decreased fertility simply by increasing the frequency of her unprotected sexual encounters.Unfortunately, recounted Denise, that plan didn't work out so well. For one, she found that as she approached middle age, she had fewer and fewer opportunities for casual sex. And not only that, the casual encounters she did manage to have were less than satisfying.""In other words,"" she summarized ruefully, ""casual sex has been increasingly hard to come by. In every sense.""The maternally-called Denise initially turned to her ob-gyn for help in getting pregnant. He recommended expensive fertility treatments, in which eggs from younger, more fertile donors would be implanted into her uterus. However, Denise couldn't afford the pricey procedure.Then, just when she thought that she might have to relinquish her four-year-long-dream of becoming a middle-aged mom, Denise learned about forced molting.""When I first saw the conditions of those hens,"" she said, ""I couldn't believe it. They're frail, boney, bald - utterly pathetic! And it occurred to me that if forced molting works for them, why shouldn't it work for me, too? I'm in much better shape.""And so, beginning six months ago, Denise embarked upon her own self-created program of forced - or in her case, voluntarily induced - molting, going weeks at a time without food or natural light in order to jolt her body into ovulating outside its normal cycle. She's found it highly encouraging that, just as molting hens lose their feathers, she has lost all her hair.That being said, the forced molting process has not been a walk in the park, says Denise - not by any stretch of the imagination.For one, she'd thought that she'd found the ideal forced molting site in her favorite dark, dingy, food-desert neighborhood dive-bar. Realizing, however, that ingesting copious amounts of cheap beer might not be improving her fertility (although it did seem to improve her chances of having casual sex), Denise has since abandoned her dive-bar molting ""shed"" in favor of her windowless Manhattan apartment - which, she says, bears a marked similarity to the cramped, light-deprived edifices that house egg-laying hens.The big question, of course, is...is it working?Denise thinks so. Although she is not yet pregnant, she is confident that it is only a matter of time before her self-prescribed combination of forced molting and casual sex results in pregnancy.""I can feel the ovulation,"" she avows. ""Dozens and dozens of eggs, dropping down into my uterus by the day. Oops, there goes another one right now! Did you hear it?""In fact, Denise believes that her ovulation has been so amped-up by the process of forced molting that she will actually have eggs left over after her pregnancy is complete - eggs which she hopes to sell to a fertility clinic for a hefty fee.A tender smile appearing on her face, she remarks, ""Never too soon to start thinking about my kid's college fund, right?""Clearly, this middle-aged Manhattan ""chick"" is already thinking like a mother hen...",19.84,14.8,9.29,5.51,14.17,14.8,4.72,4.88,4.88,1.73,4.88,8.35,0,0,0.63,0.31,3.15,1,0

288,1,"The University of California has adopted a new policy requiring all students who identify with being Caucasian to purchase mandatory ""Free Speech Insurance"" as part of enrollment fees, $1,000 per-semester, set to begin in the fall semester of 2016. The idea had been bouncing around for about a year until the UC Board of Trustees was able to put all the logistics in place. The concept of mandatory Free Speech Insurance (FSI) is based on the belief that ""free speech"" and ""safe spaces"" on campus are mutually exclusive as they stem from fundamentally different belief systems that are diametrically opposed to one another. ""Words that express unadulterated individual thought are by definition hurtful to those who do not experience such thoughts,"" stated professor Lilly Barnes, instructor in Modern Ethics and Safe-Think during an open forum dedicated to explaining the new policy to students. ""Only by suppressing individual thought and following standards of pre-approved collective thought prepared for you by caring academic professionals, can we achieve the safety of thinking in unison and make our campus a safe space for everyone. This is what my mandatory course in Safe-Think will help you to achieve.""""The problem with this country,"" continued Barnes, ""is that freely expressed individual ideas almost always lead to delusional thoughts and perceptions that can be described as anti-progressive, racist, sexist, bigoted, or Islamophobic. Unfortunately, we can't yet jail people for unfiltered expression of their Caucasianism as it exists in their unguided and dangerously delusional minds. As a result, many minority students are constantly bombarded with white and heteronormative micro-aggressions, which causes them to suffer extreme mental and emotional traumas. So the next best thing to arresting all white students is to make them purchase mandatory Free Speech Insurance that will be used to compensate for any emotional damage minority students may suffer in accidents caused by unapproved speech or any other expression of non-safe individual thought on our campus.""""Minority students will be exempt from purchasing FSI because we believe they are incapable of individual thought and don't have the capacity to reason and act independently,"" Barnes said. ""But a white mouth that is free to speak, is no less dangerous than an assault machine gun. I see it everywhere I go on this campus. I become alarmed whenever I see a group of white students standing around without a single minority in their midst. I am not deaf, I can clearly hear them talk about things like movies, or video games, or even sports - without acknowledging how their white privilege provided them with those opportunities. It makes me want to vomit."" Professor Barnes further illustrated her point with a recent example of the damages caused by unregulated freedom of expression on campus. It happened when an African-American student overheard a group of Asian students saying that the boycott of the Oscars was ""ridiculous"" while they were all having lunch in one of the University's cafeterias. The fact that this blatant microaggression did not come directly from Caucasian students made things even worse, as the well-trained African-American student was still able to detect white racism compounded by cultural appropriation, which raised the incident classification to ""aggravated assault."" This made the African-American student so emotionally distraught that they could not attend class for three weeks and now they require costly biweekly therapy visits. That is where Free Speech Insurance will come in. It will cover the cost of the therapy and rehabilitation of victims of unregulated, freely expressed Caucasian ideas. Even in cases when the offensive speech does not come from white students directly but is culturally appropriated from them by misguided minorities, the burden of payment will still be distributed among the Caucasians whose fault it is that offensive ideas exist in the first place.To further the University's goal of making the campus ""a universal safe space,"" the institution has also announced that it will be removing courses that focus on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights since those documents are believed to ""encourage division and bigotry among the student body"" by promoting criminally delusional ideas of individual freedom, thought, and expression. These courses will be replaced with professor Lilly Barnes's collectivist ""Safe-Think"" and other classes that promote intellectual unanimity and emotional awareness of hurtful and offensive speech, all of which should lead to lower FSI premiums in the future. According to the official statement, the school administrators are hopeful they will live to see the day when Free Speech Insurance will no longer be required as all students will be properly trained in collectivism and unanimous thinking, providing a safe learning environment for everyone on the UC Berkeley campus.",30.27,9.78,3.94,5.84,14.61,12.58,5.46,3.43,6.86,3.81,3.3,3.81,0,0,0,0,3.56,1,0
289,1,"If you cringe at NSA's methods of gathering dirt on world leaders, consider what the KGB had been gathering to achieve similar results. According to the Russian media, in the 1940s Stalin's secret police had set up a special department to get its hands on foreign leaders' excrement with the ambitious aim of constructing psychological portraits by analyzing their feces. Believe it or not, the story has passed the BBC smell test.Chairman Mao became the first foreign leader whose stool was stolen by the KGB.  Retired KGB agent Igor Atamanenko, who claims he had uncovered this project while doing research in the archives of the Russian secret services, told the BBC correspondent that ""in those days the Soviets didn't have the kind of listening devices which secret services do today. That's why our specialists came up with the most extravagant ways of extracting information about a person."" Stalin's head henchman and KGB chief, Lavrenti Beria, supervised the secret stool-spying operation and reported the results personally to Stalin.In an interview with the Russian-language AIF, Atamanenko was more specific. According to him, this method was used for the first time in 1950, during Mao Zedong's visit to Moscow. Atamanenko claims that Mao and his comrades were made to wait ten days at the Kremlin reception before Stalin let them in. Some historians believe this was Stalin's way to establish dominance and bring the Chinese delegation down to size. But according to Atamanenko, Stalin himself waited that long for his agents to collect and analyze Mao's multiple stool samples for a psychological profile, so that the Soviet leader would know just what kind of man he was dealing with.The KGB plumbers had reportedly customized Mao's toilet so the Chairman's stool was extracted to a secret box and delivered to the KGB secret lab by a special courier (one wonders if the courier's title included the words ""stool pigeon"").The problem with that plan was that Mao didn't know how to use a toilet. According to the Kremlin guards assigned to the Chinese delegation, neither the Chairman nor any of the 50 other revolutionaries who accompanied him to Moscow knew the purpose of the white porcelain contraptions and used them as water fountains. Additionally, Mao spent his nights sleeping on the floor mat by the bed, while most of his fellow comrades slept in the closets because after years of hiding in the caves many of them had developed agoraphobia. Mao's excrement was examined by a crack team of KGB analysts including endocrinologists, physiologists, immunologists, diagnosticians, psychologists, and neurologists. Having examined the resulting psychological portrait, Stalin finally met with Mao Zedong. He thanked his spy team saying, ""Your conclusions were correct: this man is a radish. He's only red on the outside, but his inside is white."" (The ""white"" reference had nothing to do with race; in the communist jargon of the day ""white"" meant ""anti-red,"" as in the ""White Army"" that fought against the Red Army while wearing white uniforms.)The veteran KGB agent also claims that Nikita Khrushchev, who assumed power in 1954, put an end to this and other similar secret KGB projects. But the Soviet visionary scientist behind this idea emigrated to Israel and soon wound up in America, where his research was picked up by the CIA and used to analyze Khrushchev's excrement during his visit to the United States in September, 1959. Khrushchev's portable commode that accompanied him on his 12-day trip across America, which included New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Des Moines, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC, had been allegedly altered by the CIA to extract the Soviet leader's stool samples. The toilet at Camp David, where Khrushchev met with President Eisenhower, had also been modified, says Atamanenko. He also claims that the CIA spiked Khrushchev's food with laxatives to ensure the abundance of research data. It is unclear how the retired KGB veteran came in possession of this information, but it is worth mentioning that at a press conference following Camp David, Khrushchev acknowledged that he had been ""enriched"" by his visit and that his talks with Eisenhower had helped both men ""understand each other better."" A similar story allegedly happened during Leonid Brezhnev's American trip in 1973. Atamanenko doesn't say how he knows this, but we found circumstantial evidence in the U.S. media reports about a noticeable chemistry and even bromance between Brezhnev and Richard Nixon. What had prompted Nixon to discover a soulmate in the Soviet leader is anyone's guess, but the KGB veteran's revelations may finally put this issue to rest. Atamanenko provides no comment on the reasons why Ronald Reagan walked out of negotiations on strategic missiles with Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1986 summit in Reykjavik, but in light of this new information we may deduce that Gorbachev's stool sample that day posed a serious security risk.The veteran Soviet agent finishes his story with a tale about the six golden toilets in the residence of Hafez al-Assad, former Syrian ruler and father of today's Syrian dictator, Bashar Assad. Only after Hafez al-Assad's death in 2000 did the Syrian intelligence discover that the toilets had been designed to separate the fluids from the solids, and contained a vacuum mechanism that sucked out the content and prepared it for the ""dead drop."" Russian intelligence, which is said to be involved in this discovery, pointed the finger at Israel and the CIA, but it's also possible they were simply cleaning up their own mess. While both the FSB and CIA can neither confirm nor deny that they spent decades examining each other's feces, the public can always rely on applicable common-sense rules: who observed it served it, who deduced it produced it, who denied it supplied it, and who smelt it dealt it.No matter how touching we may find the vision of a world whose leaders learn about each other's personalities from each other's excrement, let's keep in mind that the story of the American research into the Soviet leaders' stool samples may well be a ""journalistic deodorant"" sprayed over Stalin's ""fecal espionage"" story when it leaked to the media. Russian officials have the penchant for preemptive damage control by polluting the media narrative with manufactured counter-narrative, making up nonsensical chaff stories that compete for attention on equal terms with objective reality. This way, even when the stolen stool hits the fan, they can always say, ""everybody's doing it.""And yet we can't help but wonder: what exactly is happening during the prolonged negotiations in Geneva - and could more fiber in the menu expedite the process? In particular, how exactly did the U.S. and the Iranian delegations test each other's mettle during the recent nuclear talks in Paris, and what did John Kerry and Barack Obama find out about the Iranians that convinced them they can be trusted to hold up their end of the bargain?And finally, in the pre-computer age, how would a whistleblower like Snowden go about exposing such a dirty government secret to the public? And even if he managed to steal what we might now call the ""data dump"" in its physical form and gave it to a Wikileaks-type organization, how would that outfit go about blasting it all over the world?

302,0,"Scientists have for the first time detected gravitational waves, ripples in space and time hypothesized by Albert Einstein a century ago, in a landmark discovery announced on Thursday that opens a new window for studying the cosmos.The researchers said they detected gravitational waves coming from two distant black holes - extraordinarily dense objects whose existence also was foreseen by Einstein - that orbited one another, spiralled inward and smashed together. They said the waves were the product of a collision between two black holes roughly 30 times the mass of the Sun, located 1.3 billion light years from Earth....Ladies and gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves. We did it,.. said California Institute of Technology physicist David Reitze, triggering applause at a packed news conference in Washington....It's been a very long road, but this is just the beginning,.. Louisiana State University physicist Gabriela Gonzalez told the news conference, touting the opening of a new era in astronomy.The scientific milestone was achieved using a pair of giant laser detectors in the United States, located in Louisiana and Washington state, capping a decades-long quest to find these waves....The colliding black holes that produced these gravitational waves created a violent storm in the fabric of space and time, a storm in which time speeded up, and slowed down, and speeded up again, a storm in which the shape of space was bent in this way and that way,.. Caltech physicist Kip Thorne said.The two laser instruments, which work in unison, are known as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). They were able to detect remarkably small vibrations from passing gravitational waves. After detecting the gravitational wave signal, the scientists said they converted it into audio waves and were able to listen to the sounds of the two black holes merging....We're actually hearing them go thump in the night,.. Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Matthew Evans said. ...We're getting a signal which arrives at Earth, and we can put it on a speaker, and we can hear these black holes go, 'Whoop.' There's a very visceral connection to this observation...The scientists said they first detected the gravitational waves last Sept. 14....We are really witnessing the opening of a new tool for doing astronomy,.. MIT astrophysicist Nergis Mavalvala said in an interview. ...We have turned on a new sense. We have been able to see and now we will be able to hear as well...Einstein in 1916 proposed the existence of gravitational waves as an outgrowth of his ground-breaking general theory of relativity, which depicted gravity as a distortion of space and time triggered by the presence of matter. But until now scientists had found only indirect evidence of their existence.Scientists said gravitational waves open a door for a new way to observe the universe and gain knowledge about enigmatic objects like black holes and neutron stars. By studying gravitational waves they also hope to gain insight into the nature of the very early universe, which has remained mysterious.Everything we know about the cosmos stems from electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, visible light, infrared light, X-rays and gamma rays. But because such waves encounter interference as they travel across the universe, they can tell only part of the story.Gravitational waves experience no such barriers, meaning they can offer a wealth of additional information. Black holes, for example, do not emit light, radio waves and the like, but can be studied via gravitational waves.The scientists said that because gravitational waves are so radically different from electromagnetic waves they expect them to reveal big surprises about the universe.Scientists sounded positively giddy over the discovery....This is the holy grail of science,.. said Rochester Institute of Technology astrophysicist Carlos Lousto. ...The last time anything like this happened was in 1888 when Heinrich Hertz detected the radio waves that had been predicted by James Clerk Maxwell's field-equations of electromagnetism in 1865,.. added Durham University physicist Tom McLeish....It is really a truly, truly exciting event,.. said Abhay Ashtekar, director of Penn State University's Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos. ...It opens a brand new window on the universe...Ashtekar said heavy celestial objects bend space and time but because of the relative weakness of the gravitational force the effect is miniscule except from massive and dense bodies like black holes and neutron stars. He said that when these objects collide, they send out ripples in the curvature of space and time that propagate as gravitational waves.A black hole, a region of space so packed with matter that not even photons of light can escape the force of gravity, was detected for the first time in 1971.Neutron stars are small, about the size of a city, but are extremely heavy, the compact remains of a larger star that died in a supernova explosion.The LIGO observatories are funded by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the U.S. government.",21.84,7.47,3.25,4.22,13.86,9.88,5.42,3.73,3.86,0.24,4.82,5.78,0,0,0,0,2.65,1,0

His tour comes as the Liberal government, celebrating its 100th day in office, looks to reinvigorate relations with the international institution.UN secretary general urges Trudeau to focus on aid target (CP Video)...Ladies and gentlemen, the weather here is quite cold, but the relationship between the United Nations and Canada are very, very warm,.. Mr. Ban said during a joint press conference with the Prime Minister. ...Mr. Trudeau has declared Canada's recommitment to the United Nations. I am here to declare that the United Nations .._ welcomes this commitment...Part of that re-engagement process is an eventual bid for a rotating, non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, Mr. Trudeau said, repeating a promise he made during the election campaign. However, the Prime Minister did not indicate when Canada would launch its bid....We're looking at a number of windows in the coming years. We're going to evaluate the opportunities for Canada to mount a successful bid and we will have more to say about that in due course,.. Mr. Trudeau said.The former Conservative government was often highly critical of the UN after a failed bid to win a Security Council seat in 2010.Mr. Ban also acknowledged former Canadian prime minister Lester B.

Mr. Trudeau said Canada is interested in working in areas where sexual violence is used a weapon of war. He also took some suggestions from Mr. Ban....One of the suggestions that I greatly appreciate and that we will consider is having Canada send in not just more police officers, but more women, female police officers, in order to provide assistance,.. Mr. Trudeau said in French. ...I acknowledge the importance of having francophone, bilingual forces involved...Mr. Trudeau said the government is currently in talks with the UN to see how Canada can re-engage in peacekeeping missions, but did not indicate any regions or countries it would be interested in doing so.The pair also discussed Canada's climate change commitments, including Mr. Trudeau's leadership at the Paris climate summit last year, the ongoing crisis in global hot spots such as Syria and Iraq, and the government's plan to resettle tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.Mr. Ban said this is the fifth time he has travelled to Canada as secretary-general, and the first time since Mr. Trudeau took office.

304,0,"Dennis Oland has been sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 10 years for the second-degree murder of his father.Oland's lawyer pleaded Thursday that the judge consider his client's children in setting the sentence.Defence lawyer Gary Miller provided Justice John Walsh with character references from Oland's family saying he was needed and loved and is a good caregiver. He said the case doesn't require more than the minimum of 10 years before parole eligibility....I beg your lordship, give him the kind of sentence that allows him to get home to his family as soon as possible,.. said Miller during the hearing in the Saint John courtroom.Oland declined an offer from the judge to offer his own comments earlier in the day.Before handing down the sentence, Walsh said a pre-sentence report described Oland as a well-educated, 47-year-old man with no previous criminal record. He also said Oland told a parole officer that he can't feel remorse because he is innocent....This was a family tragedy of Shakespearean proportions,.. Walsh said.A jury found Oland guilty of Richard Oland's murder in December following a trial that lasted four months and captured widespread public attention.A conviction on second-degree murder carries a life sentence with a range of parole eligibility set between 10 and 25 years. All 12 jurors recommended that Oland have no chance of parole for 10 years.But Crown lawyer Patrick Wilbur said the brutal nature of the elder Oland's death called for a sentence more than the minimum 10 years required under the law. He called for between 12 and 15 years in jail before parole eligibility.Richard Oland's body was found face down in a pool of blood in his Saint John office on July 7, 2011. He had suffered 45 blunt and sharp force blows to his head, neck and hands, although no weapon was ever found.Sheriffs had to turn most supporters away from attending Thursday's hearing after a lineup formed in front of the courthouse before the sentencing.However, members of the Oland family were seated in the front row of the hearing and close 100 people were crammed into the rows behind.Walsh was given 73 character reference letters, 10 of which the Crown objected to, during the morning hearing.The judge told the defence lawyers it was offensive that some of the character references used their letters as Trojan horses to give their personal opinions on the case....It's upsetting to me as a judge that people would do that,.. Walsh said, adding the only opinions that count were those of the jury....I am not pleased...After a break, defence lawyers withdrew seven of the letters, and redacted three more to remove opinions about the verdict. Walsh also placed a provisional publication ban on four letters from Oland's children....I'm concerned about their privacy,.. he said.Oland was dressed in the same brown suit and blue shirt he wore through much of the trial, and he smiled at family and supporters as he entered the courtroom.After his conviction, Oland's mother Connie said in statement the family was shocked by the outcome.An appeal of the conviction has since been filed but no date has been set. A bail hearing will be held Friday in Fredericton as Oland's lawyers seek his release pending the hearing of the appeal.The Olands are an establishment family in the history of the Maritimes, having founded Moosehead Breweries although Richard Oland left the family business in 1981.During the trial, the Crown focused on possible issues of motive including Dennis Oland's financial difficulties and the knowledge his father was having an affair.The key piece of evidence for the Crown was a brown jacket worn by Dennis Oland that had a number of small blood stains and also DNA that matched the profile of Richard Oland.Oland has repeatedly denied any involvement in his father's death.",20.12,7.08,4.67,2.41,15.66,11.14,4.52,1.51,4.52,2.56,4.97,3.01,0,0,0,0,1.51,0,0
305,0,"Ontario's real estate regulator says it is considering warning agents to play by the rules when it comes to flipping houses, after British Columbia's move to clamp down on the controversial, but legal, practice of selling assignments.The Real Estate Council of Ontario, the self-governing body that regulates the province's real estate industry, says it doesn't believe the practice of assignment flipping is widespread in Ontario. However, it is closely watching developments in B.C., where regulators have promised an investigation into concerns some agents are not properly disclosing their financial interests in a sale....The reporting out of B.C. certainly has been pushed to the front burner of our attention and we're certainly monitoring what's going on,.. said Kelvin Kucey, deputy registrar of regulatory compliance for Ontario's real estate council.Ontario's regulator is considering issuing a registrar's bulletin, a formal notice to industry members, reminding them that agents must disclose their interests in a prospective sale to everyone involved in the transaction, along with disclosing any information that could potentially affect the value of the property.Mr. Kucey said the council also wanted to encourage sellers to do their due diligence if they're approached by an agent offering to buy their home, which includes making sure they're getting the best price....If this is a concern as a seller that somebody may be buying the property at a lower price than what you think, maybe you need to ask some more questions with regards to what the basis of the market analysis is and then don't stop at the first analysis that you get,.. he said.The Ontario industry's reaction comes after a Globe and Mail investigation revealed some agents in B.C. have reaped massive profits through a practice known as a contract assignment, which involves arranging a sale and then finding a new buyer willing to pay more before the deal closes, in essence ...assign-ing...The revelations triggered a swift reaction from B.C. Premier Christy Clark, who said the province was prepared to take more control over the real estate brokerage sector if it did not immediately move to discourage the technique.In Ontario, as in B.C., there are no reliable data on assignments. The practice is legal and some argue it is an important element of the housing industry that allows buyers to get out of a costly deal if their personal circumstances suddenly change.However, several provinces require Realtors to get the consent of the seller in advance before assigning a deal to a new buyer.Ontario's real estate council received 11 complaints last year about improper disclosure by Realtors, but said most involved minor paper-work issues, not ...malicious intent......The assignment aspect really hasn't crystallized in Ontario on a complaint basis,.. Mr. Kucey said. ...But obviously we're monitoring what's going on in British Columbia and if we have complaints where this is actually taking place in Ontario, we will investigate. And if the evidence is there, we'll certainly prosecute any Realtor who is not abiding by the rules and regulations...Assignments were never a major issue in Alberta even during the province's real estate-boom years and have become less of a concern in the current soft market, said Natalie Scollard of the Real Estate Council of Alberta. ...This is the type of thing you would be more likely to see in a rising, escalating market, which Alberta is not right now,.. she said.The province banned so called ...dual agency,.. where Realtors can represent both a seller and a buyer, in 2008. It was replaced with something called a transaction brokerage, where a realtor can help both sides do a deal, but can't act on behalf of either party and must keep details of both confidential.In Toronto, where fierce bidding wars have broken out for detached homes and prices of some properties have soared at double-digit annual rates, Realtors say they have yet to see widespread evidence of the issues facing Vancouver's market, where Realtors have been able to flip properties in a matter of days or weeks at a massive markup. The Toronto Real Estate Board issued a statement saying it was ...not aware of any concerns.. about assignment flipping....We haven't come across it a lot yet in the city,.. said Adam Brind, broker at Core Assets Inc. in downtown Toronto. ...But that doesn't mean that maybe we won't start to see it if prices and demand keep growing in Toronto...In some cases, prospective buyers have lost out on a bidding war and have approached the winning buyer about reselling the property at a higher price. Mr. Brind saw one deal in which a losing bidder offered the successful buyers an extra $100,000 to purchase a property only days after they had bought it.Toronto was once home to an active assignment market for preconstruction condos, in which investors bought units at a discount years before a building was constructed and then sold the assignment rights to speculators hoping to cash in on future price increases, often paying fees to a developer for the privilege. The practice has slowed in recent years as developers realized they could price their preconstruction units higher and keep those profits for themselves.",27.41,7.18,2.85,4.33,14.48,13.91,4.68,3.31,3.99,1.25,4.79,4.9,0,0,0,0,2.51,0,1

Currently, 75 percent of residential care beds are in single rooms....It's cold comfort if you are ... in a four-bed ward instead of your own room,.. said Mackenzie. ...Everybody should have their own bed and own bathroom...Marie Morris's mother Rosa Pellizzari, 94, was recently placed in a four-person room. She shared a small space with three other seniors with only curtains hanging between the beds for privacy.The family was told if they didn't take the bed at the Willingdon Care Centre in Burnaby, Pellizzari would be taken off the waiting list for long-term residential care. Willingdon Care Centre has a contract with the Fraser Healthy Authority, and is a privately owned facility with 95 seniors living in rooms housing two to four seniors. The facility has 10 single rooms....I had no options in placing my mother in this awful place. All health authorities have a policy that the first available bed must be accepted. As a family member I felt railroaded and feel that my mother was held hostage,.. said Morris....The bed spaces were smaller than what you would get in a hospital today. We tried to personalize the space, but it was impossible...Morris said it's unethical for the government to force seniors into such crowded quarters.A Ministry of Health Statement reads in part: ...The ministry understands single occupancy rooms are ideal and we are committed to creating a baseline inventory to track and monitor progress on the number of single occupancy rooms renovated and built...Since 2000, all newly licensed residential care facilities under the Community Care and Assisted Living Act have been required to provide private bedrooms to residents....New facilities licensed since that time have been permitted to house up to five per cent of residents in double occupancy rooms, as long as certain conditions are met. This helps to allow for flexibility, and also helps to accommodate couples, for example...There are no immediate plans to upgrade Willingdon Care Centre, nor a fixed timeline to redevelop any of the 11 other facilities where three or more seniors share a room, said Tasleem Juma of Fraser Health.Under the Hospital Act, facilities in 2000 were ...grandfathered.. to allow for multi-occupancy rooms. In Fraser Health, for instance, Queens Park Care Centre has 32 rooms of three or more seniors sharing a room while Willingdon Care Centre has 10 such rooms....All of our new residential care facilities, including the 403 beds scheduled to open this spring, follow the legislated guidelines related to (single room) occupancy,.. said Juma.Morris said it isn't right that older facilities are allowed to operate under different rules....It is amazing to me that we put frail seniors into such horrible environments that do not come close to meeting the standards outlined in the Residential Care Act,.. she said.Morris said she considered Willingdon Care ...overcrowded.. and witnessed lots of frustration among its residents....I wonder if that is one of the causes of seniors lashing out against one another or against the care providers,.. she said.Mackenzie said her office is conducting a systemic review of resident-on-resident aggression in B.C. nursing homes, and it could end up showing seniors living in multi-resident rooms have a higher incidence of resident on resident aggression....I think that those of us who have worked in the field all know significant agitation can arise by sharing a room. It's common sense,.. said Mackenzie.Last year, there were more than 1,000 resident-on-resident assaults in B.C. nursing homes. Approximately 550 resulted in a senior requiring first aid or hospitalization. There have also been 16 deaths of seniors -  mostly caused by other seniors with dementia -  in the past four years in B.C....With a dementia population, certain triggers can ignite outbursts of aggression, and for those sharing a room there's no possibility to escape that,.. said Mackenzie. ...To me one of the solutions is they get their own room and bathroom. That should be the base level...Morris said as soon as her mother was placed at Willingdon, she lobbied to move her. After 10 days, Pellizzari was moved to a single room in Normanna Rest Home in Burnaby....The difference is like night and day...According to the Office of the Seniors Advocate, there are 44 facilities in B.C. that have rooms with three to five people sharing the space.The BC Care Providers Association agrees rooms for three to five seniors should be phased out but still see a role for some double rooms. The organization, which represents care providers who supply over 60 per cent of the publicly funded beds in B.C., believes it's financially unsustainable to have 95 per cent of all residents in single occupancy rooms....A facility with 100 beds that must have at least 95 per cent of the rooms as single rooms would cost a minimum of $24,500,000 to build. If, instead, 75 per of the beds were single rooms, a facility with 100 beds would cost $22,250,000 to build. This is a savings of $2,250,000 in construction costs per care home, or a savings of almost 10 per cent of current construction costs,.. the report states. ...These substantially lower construction costs would make operating a private care home in B.C. more sustainable in the long-run...The association's CEO Daniel Fontaine said the industry is moving away from homes that have quad rooms, and as older nursing homes are replaced they are building facilities where most rooms are singles.But, he added, many of his association's members who represent 145 of the 331 long term care facilities in the province already have empty beds in single rooms that could accommodate seniors living in multiple-resident rooms now. Members in Fraser Health, for instance, have 1,000 beds set aside for private clients but 100 of these stand empty....If the Ministry of Health has it as a priority (for seniors in nursing homes to be in single rooms) I'm willing to sit at a table tomorrow with them to discuss a plan,.. he said. ...A lot of this comes down to dollars and secondly to logistics. It's not something we've had a large discussion with them about existing capacity within care...",19.22,7.41,3.35,4.06,15.78,14.81,3.97,2.03,4.41,0.97,6.44,4.85,0.09,0,0,0,3.35,0,1

While syphilis rates have increased in all age groups, the largest increase is among 20 to 24-year-olds, marking a shift to younger men.VCH and the BCCDC recommend that men who have sex with men get tested every three to six months, and visit their health care provider if they have sores, bumps, a rash, blisters or warts on or around their genitals or anal area.

Sutter has a broken jaw, Edler a fractured fibula.They won't be back any time soon and Desjardins did not try and pretend that the loss of the two veterans won't hurt....They are difficult injuries in all facets of our game,.. Desjardins said. ...Right-handed draw man, two guys who are on the first unit (power play). They are big losses...They come, of course, at the worst possible time for the Canucks, who had finally got completely healthy. Desjardins said he had a good feeling about his team heading into this two-game road trip and shared his optimism with his players before Tuesday night's game in Denver....Coming into the Colorado game I said, guys, it's all set for us to start playing good. The guys that were injured had played a couple of games. . .now everybody is back, we've had a couple of games, so there's no reason we don't start playing the way we can play. That is how I felt. I think the team was excited, the team felt that way....Even though we had lost a few, we had played pretty good in those games, we were confident that we were still there in the hunt. Now it's a matter of finding a way again. You have to battle and you have to stay in it until you come back and get healthy again...Desjardins had to make a couple of lineup changes on Wednesday night and one of them figured to be controversial, but was changed before the game when Derek Dorsett was unable to play due to an illness.As expected, Alex Biega, a healthy scratch for the last two games, stepped in for Edler. But Desjardins' initial plan was to play Adam Cracknell instead of rookie Jared McCann. That would have been three straight games for McCann as a healthy scratch.Desjardins said before the game he feared a possible match up against Coyotes centre Martin Hanzal....If he gets matched up against Hanzal, that's a tough matchup for a guy,.. Desjardins said. ...Hanzal is a big boy. It is going to happen, but I think it's probably a better matchup at home...McCann was inserted into the lineup when Dorsett was unable to play.Desjardins acknowledged that he will be second-guessed for some of his lineup decisions in the weeks to come.

Capital spending will drop to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion from a December forecast of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, while the quarterly payout will sink to five cents from 16 cents.Cenovus announced the cuts in a statement on Thursday as it posted a loss of $641 million, or 77 cents a share in the quarter, compared with a loss of $472 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier....We must remain focused on maintaining our financial resilience through 2016 and beyond, ensuring that we don't compromise the balance sheet strength we've worked so hard to achieve, so that we are well placed to maximize shareholder value when commodity prices improve,.. chief executive Brian Ferguson said in the statement.The planned capital spending reductions at the Foster Creek and Christina Lake sites are expected to have minimal impact on the company's oilsands production for 2016, the company said in the statement.Cenovus almost doubled oil and liquids production to 210,000 barrels a day late last year from 107,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2009.

316,0,"In the magnificent words of the Tragically Hip, in their 1989 Boots or Hearts song, when it starts to fall apart, man, it really falls apart.At the just-concluded sexual assault trial of the fallen CBC star Jian Ghomeshi, prosecutors Mike Callaghan and Corie Langdon didn't have long to wait.Their first unpleasant surprise came on opening day last week with the first of three female accusers in the witness stand in a Toronto courtroom -  she was and is still considered their strongest complainant and is certainly the least discredited -  but it sure didn't stop there.Complainant No. 2, Trailer Park Boys actor and Royal Canadian Air Force captain Lucy DeCoutere, who waived the mandatory publication ban on her identity and thus became the face and symbol of Ghomeshi's accusers, was next.Despite protestations she had no romantic or sexual interest in Ghomeshi after her purported assault -  ...I guarantee you that,.. she told his lead lawyer, the formidable Marie Henein -  it turned out she had all but stalked the 48-year-old former star -  all this after he'd allegedly choked and slapped her hard in the face -  and had told him in an email she wanted to ...f-  your brains out...A few days later, DeCoutere wrote him an old-school love letter that ended with the line ...I love your hands...Incredibly, the last complainant flamed out even more spectacularly as Henein got her to acknowledge she'd told lies, omitted details and deliberately misled police and prosecutors and then confronted her with the fact that after the alleged attack, she had taken Ghomeshi home with her one night and, as the lawyer so inimitably put it, ...messed around and gave him a hand job...The latter two accusers -  the former Q host is pleading not guilty to four sex assault charges and one of choking DeCoutere -  made 11th-hour disclosures of some of these details only on the eve of their taking the witness stand. The disclosures came so late they sandbagged prosecutors and left them unable to combat them.But though these developments caused actual gasps in the crowded Old City Hall courtroom and had lawyers the city over reeling in disbelief at the havoc unfolding in courtroom No. 125, the die had been cast long before that.As one veteran Toronto lawyer put it this week, ...the criminal justice system has been hijacked by ideology,.. in this instance, the feminist chant that accusers must always be believed.The Ghomeshi prosecution was born in the late fall/early winter of 2014 in the same maelstrom that saw Bill Cosby first called out as a rapist, the Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women movement find wind under its social media wings, two Liberal MPs in Ottawa kicked out of caucus with shredded reputations after vague and anonymous allegations from New Democrat MPs and a developing ...national conversation.. about sexual assault and harassment and the barriers to reporting it.The prosecution originally, floridly unfolded in the pages of one of the country's biggest newspaper, the Toronto Star, which first published allegations against Ghomeshi by what were then three anonymous women, and then on social media through Twitter hashtags such as #IBelieveLucy, #BeenRapedNeverReported (started in support of the Ghomeshi accusers, it grew like wildfire) and the more generic #IBelieveThem.This publicity alone spelled trouble enough for the complainants in court.The alleged victims reported to Toronto Police only after they had been well-interviewed -  in DeCoutere's case, nine times -  in the pages of the Star and other newspapers and on air at the CBC and other stations.While that may have been empowering for the women, it meant their versions of what happened were well on the public record already -  and that meant any inconsistencies or differences between what they told the media and what they told police were there for the getting by the defence team.Witness credibility always matters in court, but particularly in sex assault cases, where almost by definition other witnesses are scarce, and especially with historic or dated allegations like these, where the events took place in 2002 and 2003 and any potential forensic evidence is long lost.Additionally, DeCoutere and the third complainant quickly bonded as online friends over Ghomeshi, and in less than a year from Oct. 29, 2014 to Sept. 23 last year, the two women exchanged more than 5,000 Facebook messages.(The first complainant was not similarly tainted.)That raised the spectre of witness collusion, and certainly, with the two women regularly reporting in to one another when they met with detectives or prosecutors, tracking Ghomeshi's every court appearance and gleefully savouring his fall from grace, it was at least damaging.It was particularly galling in DeCoutere's case, for in the same period that she was nodding her head sorrowfully in TV interviews about Ghomeshi's situation and professing compassion for him, she was telling her newfound Facebook friend, ...I want him f- ing decimated...There was, in other words, a lynching in the collective air.For a time, it appeared as though anyone who had ever had a date with Ghomeshi, good or bad, felt the need to go online and ...share.. it -  and months where his name appeared far more often in major Canadian news outlet headlines than Cosby's.It was reminiscent of the curious child abuse/satanic ritual/predator ring cases that seemed to sweep across North America in the 1980s and early 1990s -  notorious among them the McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where allegations grew ever wilder as 384 youngsters were identified as having been sexually abused; the Little Rascals day care in Edenton, N.C., which saw the allegedly victimized children name a total of 30 abusers, and, closer to home, the historic child abuse allegations in Cornwall, Ont., which eventually grew to become claims that ...a clan of pedophiles.. of prominent local citizens was operating in town.What those cases have in common is that, for a time, suspicion itself appeared downright contagious, and the procedure for interviewing ostensible victims was deeply flawed.What happened in the Ghomeshi case isn't the same, of course, but there are echoes enough to be troubling.As the allegations against Ghomeshi in the media and online grew, the pressure mounted on the police: Why did none of these women feel ...safe.. reporting to them?Four days after the CBC fired Ghomeshi and the Star published its first story on the scandal, then-chief Bill Blair encouraged women to report....Our first priority is their safety,.. he said of the alleged victims, ...and their recovery...It was an astonishing remark for the head of an agency whose primary function, many would have imagined, was to investigate allegations of crime, not comfort those reporting it.Yet two days later, Inspector Joanna Beaven-Desjardins, commander of the force's sex crimes unit, held a press conference to announce that three women had come forward with allegations against Ghomeshi.In a question-and-answer session afterwards, speaking generally, Beaven-Desjardins said repeatedly that ...We believe victims when they come in, 100%, we are behind them 100%,.. and ...We believe them right from the onset, there's never a doubt about believing them.. and ...it's all about the victims and moving them forward...The three Ghomeshi accusers all duly pronounced themselves satisfied by their treatment at the hands of police. All said they felt ...safe.. and respected.The results of the investigation itself are less clear.But what did emerge about the probe at trial isn't encouraging.The first complainant, for instance, was interviewed once, a process that took less than an hour and which, after time deducted for various standard cautions, saw the woman ...tell her story.. for 14 minutes, and detectives question her for a grand total of 35 minutes.And when the third complainant arranged to give her late-in-the-day second statement, and told the officers what it was about -  that ...little detail.. about her taking Ghomeshi home and masturbating him -  the detectives spent only nine minutes asking her about the encounter, nine minutes after 13 months of the woman steadfastly maintaining she'd kept her distance from Ghomeshi after the alleged assault.Strangely, given the remarkable nature of the disclosure, the interview wasn't recorded.This isn't the first time the practices of the sex assault unit and Beaven-Desjardins have been criticized.Late last month, lawyer Brian Greenspan said that against the clear advice of senior prosecutors, whom unusually in this instance were consulted by police, the unit last fall laid a sex assault charge it knew would fail against prominent Brazilian soccer star Lucas Domingues Piazon and smeared him as a rapist at a press conference.The charge was withdrawn Jan. 26.Justice William Horkins, defence lawyer Marie Henein, the third complainant and Crown attorney Michael Callaghan appear at Ghomeshi's sexual assault trial in Toronto, Monday, Feb.8, 2016.Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner and Britain's senior law enforcement officer, wrote in The Guardian this week that it may be time for Britain to consider dropping its policy of automatically believing those who claim they have been sexually abused.The policy was embraced in 2014, of course, the year the presumption of guilt, not innocence, took hold the planet over....A good investigator,.. he wrote, ...would go and test the accuracy of the allegations and the evidence with an open mind.._..Test the evidence, an open mind: who could have imagined these would ever be deemed revolutionary concepts for a police force?When a jury was deadlocked in the trial of one of the chief alleged villains in the McMartin Preschool scandal, several hundred people took to the streets in protest. They carried signs that read ...We believe the children...And on the very days when DeCoutere and the third complainant were being most roundly discredited inside Old City Hall, there were still protesters on the steps outside, with signs that read #believeallsurvivors and #IBELIEVE HER.They might just as well have been covering their eyes and ears, blinder than any statue of Themis, the goddess of justice.The judge will deliver his verdict on March 24.",30.18,9.64,4.62,5.03,13.49,11.18,6.09,3.55,4.5,3.49,3.49,6.69,0.12,0.06,0.12,0,2.49,0,1
317,0,"As the Toronto office of Lifeline Syria scrambles to accommodate thousands of refugees, the question the charity's chair Ratna Omidvar and her team hears most often is: ...Can I get a tax receipt?..In many cases, the answer is no.Canada has so far welcomed more than 13,500 refugees since the Liberal government's program began last November. Of that total, close to 5,000 have been supported by private sponsors.Refugee support initiatives such as Lifeline Syria say allowing donors to receive a tax receipt when they are donating to a registered charity and suggesting a particular family to receive support would encourage more donations, ease the government's burden and make integration easier. Currently, charities can issue tax receipts to donors who indicate they'd like their donation applied to a specific area of interest, such as refugees, but not when the donation is directed to a particular family....The more Canadians step up and promote charities, the less the government is going to have to do these things,.. says Estelle Duez, a tax lawyer at LaBarge Weinstein in Ottawa....As Canadians, we are used to the notion that when we make a charitable donation, (we) will get some kind of tax relief,.. says Paul Clarke, executive director of Action R.©fugi.©s Montr.©al. He says despite the extraordinary support Canadians have shown for Syrian refugees to date, questions around tax deductibility dissuade some people from sponsorship.Mark Blumberg, a Toronto lawyer who specializes in non-profit and charity law, says the Canada Revenue Agency could make donating and sponsoring easier by clarifying the rules. Although money given to a registered refugee charity is normally tax deductible, Blumberg says the situation becomes more tricky when a donor instructs the money should go to a specific person or family, sometimes referred to as a ...general direction.. or ...directed gift...The CRA's position is that ...All decisions regarding use of the donation must rest with the charity... In other words: it cannot issue a tax receipt if a donor wants the charity to give the funds to a specified person or family, because ...such a gift is made to the person or family and not to the charity...Exceptions add to the confusion. For example, a ...general direction.. to use the gift for a ...particular program.. is acceptable, provided ...no benefit accrues to the donor.. and the gift ...does not benefit any person not dealing at arms' length with the donor...If the CRA provided greater leeway, ...there'd be more people making donations,.. says Blumberg. He cites the partial receipting of tuition costs at religious day schools.Another problem, according to Blumberg, is that so-called Groups of Five, known as G5s, cannot issue tax receipts to supporters because they are not registered charities.Immigration and citizenship defines G5s as five or more Canadian citizens or permanent residents with the financial means to be a sponsor, the ability to provide emotional and social support and living in the refugee's expected community. Due to privacy reasons, only the CRA knows who they are, says lawyer Duez. ...I doubt anyone has a clear idea of how many refugees have been sponsored by G5s to date...Moreover, G5s may be unable to receive tax receipts when they make a donation to a registered charity to help the family they are sponsoring. ...Groups of Five are the most generous but are treated the worst,.. says Blumberg. The estimated total annual settlement cost for one refugee is $12,600, which does not include in-kind expenses, such as shelter, clothing and furniture.If a G5 partners with an organization able to issue tax receipts, it can collect more donations. The Canadian Council for Refugees' executive director Janet Dench says her charity has been contacted by G5s wanting to do just that. ...If they do (get a tax receipt), people are more inclined to give larger amounts,.. says Dench.Another barrier for G5s is that they generally include Canadian members of the refugee's family. ...Any donations made by the family would be excluded from a charitable receipt because the recipient would not be at arm's length from the donor,.. says Donald Smith, chair of the Refugee Working Group at the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa.That's why many community groups are looking to sponsor refugees in partnership with the holder of a sponsorship agreement with Ottawa. Once associated with a sponsorship agreement holder (SAH), these community groups become constituent groups (CGs), allowing them to sponsor one or more refugees with the SAH's support.CGs are based in the sponsored refugee's expected community of settlement and, unlike G5s, must have their sponsorship application and settlement plan approved by a SAH.However, a group depending on a partnership with a SAH because it does not have the financial means to form a Group of Five may not meet those criteria. And organizations cannot take on a project unless it fits their core mandate as they are responsible for the use of funds for which they issue tax receipts. Says Dench: ...Organizations have to be careful about issuing charitable receipts for groups they partner with... Moreover, a SAH might not have the resources to partner with the group. ...The administrative burden can be quite a lot,.. says Dench.The third class of sponsors are Community Sponsors, which can be organizations, associations or corporations. If it is a registered charity, and if refugee sponsorship is a part of its mission or mandate, the Community Sponsor can issue a charitable receipt.Smith's experience at the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa is a cautionary tale. Since last August, the number of constituent groups under the diocese's wing has jumped from 11 to 50. Smith describes all the new sign-ons as ...inexperienced......Like everyone else in the sponsorship community I've been working seven days a week,.. he says.The advantageous nature of partnerships with SAHs is leading to overworked charities and non-profits, and many of those in the field say that's creating bottlenecks in the sponsorship process....So far the Anglican Diocese has not refused any partnerships for lack of capacity, but we are probably approaching our limit if we don't get financial support to take on more staff,.. says Smith.In spite of these headaches, Lifeline Syria's chair Omidvar continues to encourage Canadians to become refugee sponsors. ...The enthusiasm is huge. But clearly it could be bigger if one could get clarity on this,.. she says.",22.27,5.89,2.81,3.09,13.66,14.5,6.08,2.15,4.21,0.75,4.4,5.8,0.28,0,0.09,0,4.12,0,0

319,0,"TORONTO ( A city cardiologist charged with professional misconduct didn't perform physician exams on some patients, and that may have, in one case, resulted in a death that could have been prevented, an expert witness told a disciplinary hearing at The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.Testimony from the prosecution's sole witness, cardiologist Dr. David Massell of Western Cardiologist Association in Victoria, B.C., consumed Wednesday's proceedings, as college prosecutor Louis Sokolov led evidence in chief examination. Dr. William Hughes faces allegations, made public in January 2015, of failing to maintain the standard of practice of the profession, incompetence and engaging in acts or omissions that would be regarded by members as disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional.The founder of Kawartha Cardiology Clinic has denied all allegations, which haven't been proven.Massell, hired by the college in November 2012 to review Hughes, evaluated 25 patient charts based on 450 visits and interviewed the doctor on March 25, 2013. He created five reports based on his findings after dedicating 369 hours to the project.He found that 75 per cent of the diagnostic tests Hughes billed OHIP were ...inappropriate,.. that patients didn't meet the criteria for billing because they weren't physically examined during partial assessments ( which Hughes has said don't require exams.Massell also found that patients were subject to unnecessary testing, at times to the detriment of their own health, such as when they were exposed to radiation.He later explained how exposure is cumulative. Massell doesn't let his own children get X-rays when they go the dentist, over his fears for their safety.He said Hughes appeared to be testing on a routine basis, and not based on medical need. ...We should be doing these tests on patients who need them and not as a matter of routine,.. he said.On Wednesday, the five-member tribunal heard detailed evidence about four of the 25 patients, including one whose death Massell said may have been prevented had Hughes detected a heart murmur by completing a physical exam.The 29-year-old was referred to him by her family doctor, who found a heart murmur ( an unusual sound heard during a heartbeat that is the sign of abnormality.Hughes did not find the murmur because he didn't physically examine her chest, Massell said.Her exercise tolerance diminished to the point where she became short of breath and couldn't walk more than two blocks.Hughes, who was investigating her heart while being ...pretty convinced.. she had a lung problem, last saw the woman on Nov. 14, 2006.I would have thought it would be impossible to see 75 patients in a day .._ I don't think you can give patients the proper care and attention that they deserveShe was admitted to hospital from Nov. 28 to Dec. 2 and on Dec. 5, died from a lethal heart arrhythmia commonly associated with those with narrowed heart valves.The woman, who can't be named because of a publication ban, would be alive today if Hughes had identified the heart abnormality and fast-tracked the process to have her flawed valve replaced, Massell told the tribunal.Her ...problem was easily fixable,.. he said, adding how she could have been back to good health in six to eight weeks, after surgery.Massell also gave evidence involving elderly patients, saying Hughes did not complete physical exams, and said the amount of time Hughes actually spent with his patients were common concerns in each case.Hughes was seeing up to 60 to 80 patients daily, judging from the doctor's day sheets, where appointments are recorded.Those numbers are ...far beyond.. the volume of patient he and his colleagues see at their clinics, Massell said. Later in the day, he said he sees about 16 while his colleagues see from 12 to a maximum of 20 patients a day....I would have thought it would be impossible to see 75 patients in a day .._ I don't think you can give patients the proper care and attention that they deserve,.. he said.Getting to know a patient, leaning their history, coming up with a treatment plan and answering any questions they have ...all takes time,.. Massell said, noting how dictation of letters required as part of the job would take five hours alone, with Hughes' number of patients.In 75% of the cases he reviewed, a physical exam ( ...the cornerstone of what we do.. ( was not completed, the cardiologist said.Massell said he can make most of his decisions with a stethoscope, exam room and a patient. Other assessment is as an adjunct, not a substitute. Medicine, in many ways, has become over-dependent on technology, he explained.Massell explained how he began his review, in which he was tasked by the college to determine if Hughes displayed a lack of knowledge, had not met a standard of care and if his behaviours did, or was likely to, cause a patient harm or injury.The cardiologist, who had completed a similar review a decade earlier, started with the charts of Hughes' patients. He found them to be poorly organized and missing data.For example, Hughes' clinical reports were frequently in reverse chronological order, but the associated testing was not. ...It was impossible to find a report of a study to refer to because it wasn't in the right place you would expect it, right beside it...This prompted him to create a spreadsheet to help organize the materials.The volume, and age, of information on the records also ...made them very difficult to follow and understand what was happening,.. Massell said....It looked like it had been pasted from one old history and pasted forward,.. he said, later noting this could adversely affect the care of the patientsData was also missing. Some 63 per cent of the charts of the 25 patients he reviewed were not accounted for, Massell said.That figure is ...far more.. than random misplacement could account for and could have lead to medical re-ordering of testing ...that is not necessary,.. he said.As Wednesday's proceedings wrapped up, Sokolov indicated he expects to complete chief examination in about an hour Thursday.Spafford said she may complete cross-examination Thursday, but more likely Friday ( which exposed a communication breakdown regarding scheduling.Massell said he already has a flight booked to return to Vancouver Thursday night, prompting the tribunal chair to ask the lawyers to settle the matter afterwards.The hearing was scheduled to start Monday, but was postponed a day due to an illness. Tuesday was spent qualifying Massell as an expert witness.Further hearing dates were previously scheduled for March 7 to 11, March 21 to 23, April 11 to 15, and April 25 and 26. Those dates are not listed on the CPSO website.",22.18,9.2,5.84,3.36,13.97,17.33,5.04,2.03,3.63,1.15,5.04,6.9,0,0,0,0,2.3,1,0

It was released under an access to information request by Embassy newspaper.The document labeled ...Secret.. and ...Canadian eyes only.. says the property in question used to be an embassy, which had tax-exempt status, but it isn't an embassy any more.When the country moved its embassy staff elsewhere (the date is also redacted from the report), the Office of Protocol at Global Affairs Canada ...advised (the country) that the property could no longer be deemed to form part of the property of the mission, and would therefore cease to benefit from any tax exemptions related to that status...But later, City of Ottawa officials contacted Global Affairs to say that taxes weren't being paid.It's unclear whether all the back taxes are owing or only some.By last summer, the debt had passed $175,000, ...which has resulted in one of the worst debts of this nature attributed to a foreign mission recorded in recent history,.. the internal report says.The Office of Protocol sent a Note (with a capital N, meaning a formal diplomatic thing) ...to seek a swift resolution of the Embassy's accounts...Fat chance.

For example, it's allowed to shut off the water.So which country is getting a free ride courtesy of other Ottawa taxpayers? That's a secret guarded both by federal and city officials.

321,0,"Edmonton Transit is having a hard time making the buses run on time.In 2014, as few as 58 per cent of ETS buses arrived at key timing points between five minutes early and one minute late, although the goal is for them to meet this standard 90 per cent of the time, says a new city auditor's report. The system never came close to meeting the standard from 2012 to 2015 and performance, instead dropped steadily, figures in the report released Thursday indicate.The best months of the year for bus reliability are June to August -  74 per cent of the fleet was on time in this period in 2012, dropping to 69 per cent in 2014.The worst months were from December to January, when reliability dropped from 60 per cent in 2012 to 58 per cent two years later....ETS management advised us that they believe the decline in performance is a reflection of an increase in the number of persons with mobility devices and strollers, construction activity and increased traffic congestion on city streets,.. city auditor David Wiun wrote....They also advised us that the 2012 through 2015 operating budgets did not include funding to address schedule adherence and overload issues...The problem was also seen at Edmonton's 26 transit centres, where average on-time arrivals went down to 60 per cent from 63 per cent between 2012 and 2014.The latest figures show while some centres always met the proper arrival times, 19 of them were off schedule at least half the time for one period of the day, and one site only met the target for 18 per cent of trips.ETS carried 89 million passengers in 2014, growing faster than Edmonton's rapid population increase. However, that year there were an estimated 21,700 people left at the side of the road by buses that were too crowded to carry anyone else.Officials hope to reduce this problem with better scheduling, electronic SmartFare cards and Smart Buses that provide real-time arrival information.Although Wiun concluded ETS operations are being run efficiently and economically compared to other cities, he found a major jump in the amount of disorder being reported.There were 6,871 incidents such as loitering, liquor infractions, disturbances, misconduct and smoking reported by transit and downtown peace officers in 2014, up 61 per cent from the 4,264 incidents reported two years earlier.At the same time, personal crimes, such as assault, uttering threats, robbery and sexual offences, rose 14 per cent, to 339.ETS officials believe the addition of 10 peace officers in 2010 contributed to the increased reporting, the report says.Although passenger surveys showed a slight drop in satisfaction with personal safety from 2014 to 2015, at least 75 per cent of respondents still felt safe waiting or riding on ETS vehicles.The report will be discussed Feb. 19 by city council's audit committee.",25.58,3.5,1.44,2.06,16.26,9.26,5.14,2.88,5.76,1.44,3.91,6.38,0,0,0,0,0.82,0,1
322,0,"ONTREAL - Molson Coors Brewing Co. says a sluggish economy and higher food prices are affecting beer drinking in Canada's oil-rich provinces.The Denver and Montreal-based company said the beer industry has seen customers, particularly in Alberta, shift from higher-priced premium to economy brands.Overall sales volumes have also been slipping in Alberta, as well as in the oil-producing provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan.Molson said its sales volume decreased 5.4 per cent across Canada in the fourth quarter. In January, sales to retailers for at-home consumption fell by more than 10 per cent, or by almost nine per cent excluding the impact of the termination of an agreement to distribute Miller brands.Part of that decrease can be attributed to macro-economic factors, including higher food prices, said Stewart Glendinning, chief executive of Molson Coors Canada.""The consumer is under pressure,"" he said Thursday during a conference call on the company's fourth-quarter and 2015 results.""And if you add to that the fact that consumer debt in Canada is at an all-time high, it's made for quite a difficult recipe in some of those provinces.""Sales volumes for Coors Light were also reduced in Quebec by the brewer's decision to raise prices for its flagship brand.Molson Coors (TSX:TPX.B, NYSE:TAP) said its net income plummeted 65 per cent to US$32.8 million in the fourth quarter because of lower sales, currency fluctuations and reduced income from operations in Canada and the United States.The company, which reports in U.S. dollars, said its underlying profit in the quarter, excluding one-time items, was $90.6 million or 49 cents per share, down 11.3 per cent from $102.1 million or 55 cents per share a year earlier.Net sales for the period ended Dec. 31 were $844.4 million, compared were $973.8 million a year earlier -  a decrease of 13.3 per cent, or 3.5 per cent excluding currency fluctuations.In Canada, adjusted pre-tax profits from continuing operations fell 32 per cent to $51.8 million on $341.9 million in net sales. That compared with $76.2 million on US$423.1 million in net sales for the same period a year earlier.The drop in profits was partially due to a US$6.9-million currency hit from the lower Canadian dollar. Excluding currency, profits decreased 23 per cent.For the full year, the company's (TSX:TPX.B, NYSE:TAP) net profits decreased to US$359.5 million from $514 million in 2014.

Judith Guichon hit the gas pedal and took aim....Over the decades, Alberta lost its focus,.. said Guichon. ...They expected their resource boom never to end, failed to diversify their economy and lost control of government spending...I have never heard of a throne speech taking aim at another provincial government in such a negative way. It's a bit like using the Queen to take out a hit on your neighbour.In this case, BC was raising Alberta as a cautionary tale about government overspending.Critics of the Alberta government immediately took to social media to declare the NDP has made such a mess of things that the BC government is fed up and speaking out.But that's not what the speech said.By referring to ...decades.. and the ...boom,.. the speech was shooting at former Progressive Conservative governments that were in power for decades during boom times.The NDP has been in power less than a year and if the word ...boom.. is used at all these days it refers to the sound of our economy being blown apart by the depressed price of oil.But the BC speech clearly bothered Alberta's government enough that it sent out Economic Development Minister Deron Bilous to drive home the point that the NDP was never the intended target....I interpret this as an attack on the previous government and their failure to diversify the economy,.. said Bilous. (In an interview, spokesman Ben Chin with Clark's office said the reference to Alberta was indeed looking to the past, not the present).Bashing Alberta PC governments-of-old became a theme of sorts on Wednesday with the release of the latest report from Alberta's auditor general.Reports from the auditor general can be so laden with bureaucratese it would be easier to literally eat some chapters than read them. This new document is no exception but Merwan Saher also provided plenty of meat amongst the linguistic gristle.The issue he addresses first deals with the government's Royalty Reduction Programs that, in the 2014-15 fiscal year, handed out $1.4 billion in royalty reductions so that energy companies would pump out oil and gas that would otherwise be unrecoverable. The idea being the province would ultimately benefit from increased royalties from the extra oil and gas.But it turns out the government doesn't keep track of the program to see if it's actually making or losing money.We're talking here of a system introduced by previous PC governments and so it was easy on Wednesday for the new NDP government to happily point the finger of blame backwards.But there was something else on Wednesday that appeared to point the finger directly at the new Alberta government.That takes us back to Christy Clark's throne speech that made a point of saying BC's carbon tax ...is a truly revenue-neutral tax ( not an opportunistic reach into taxpayers' wallets...That had observers wondering if Clark was taking a swipe at Premier Rachel Notley's carbon tax but, again, Ben Chin in Clark's office says Notley wasn't the target....That's really aimed across the floor at our (NDP) opposition,.. said Chin. ...We have a good working relationship with the Notley government and think it's very important for us to work together for the benefit of Albertans and British Columbians...But the mix up between the NDP there and here is understandable.And you have to suspect with BC already in campaign mode ahead of an election in May of 2017, whenever Clark takes aim at her NDP opposition at home, the NDP here is going to get caught in the cross fire.",21.43,7.31,2.64,4.67,16.49,13.69,5.75,4.51,2.49,1.71,4.82,2.95,0,0,0,0,2.8,1,0

We know the pressures you'll face on the weekend and being in front of the cameras, and there's a level of comfort there that we may not have had in the past...It's been a five-star season for the Koe rink that features third Marc Kennedy, second Brent Laing and lead Ben Hebert.If you judge team Koe's year solely based on results, it would be safe to say that the team he hand-picked after the 2014 season to go on a run for an Olympic berth in 2018 is hitting its stride as the foursome settles in to defend their provincial title.So far, 2016 has been great, but Koe feels they are on the cusp of even bigger things....It's been a great year. We couldn't ask for more, really. We won a Grand Slam, a Canada Cup win that secured a spot for the Olympic Trials, and we've won a couple other events and we've just played great,.. said Koe, who sits second on the World Curling Tour money list with $112,856 in earnings....But we're still learning. A year and a half isn't really that much time for a new team and we definitely have room for improvement. I know we have a lot more in us...Koe, Bottcher and Thomas all had big wins in their opening draw on Wednesday night. Koe cruised to an 8-2 win over Brent Bawel, while Bottcher crushed Tom Sallows 9-2, and Thomas stole five straight points to earn a 7-2 win over Kevin Yablonski.While Koe's team is the heavy favourite to represent the province again at the Tim Horton's Brier in Ottawa next month, Thomas and Bottcher are the two best bets to give Koe a solid run for that Brier berth. Their experience on the big stage with prior Canadian and World Junior experience as well as their success on the World Curling Tour the past couple years will give them confidence that will likely see them front and centre come playoff time....For us, it's about playing our way. If we get stuck in the big spectacle that Koe's won it so many years in a row, that's not how we're going to win,.. said Bottcher.For Thomas, he's factored into the playoff picture in past years at provincials, but he feels this year his team that consists of third Nathan Connolly, second Brandon Klassen and lead D.J. Kidby has the ability to take it a step further....Every year you feel like you're closer, but we're still a little ways away from crossing that major threshold of getting into those big playoff games, and that will be a constant reminder this week,.. said Thomas....For us, it starts early in the week, and we have to build that consistency that hopefully gets us all the way to the final...",26.48,13.14,7.1,6.04,13.29,15.26,6.5,3.47,4.83,0.45,3.93,5.14,0,0,0,0,2.42,0,0

At that point the defence hopes to set a bail hearing date for Friday, said Martin.The funeral for 29-year-old Styres was scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at the Styres Funeral Home in Ohsweken.Styres was shot and killed in a Glanbrook driveway Feb. 4 after allegedly attempting to steal a truck.Khill was charged with second-degree murder by Hamilton police.Six Nations activist Janie Jamieson said Styres had a tough life growing up, bouncing around foster homes.She expects this death, in combination with another aboriginal man's death in Brantford this weekend, could become a watershed moment in the conversation to include men in the murdered and missing aboriginal women movement.""There's reason to believe the number of murdered and missing aboriginal men is somewhat higher than that of women,"" she said.

He lived with his aunt for a number of years before he began living on his own at around 14 or 15 years old. Styres never finished high school, but managed to develop a knack for handiwork, earning him odd jobs at Grand River Enterprises, on windmills and in general construction.Styres frequently used his skills to help his friends and family, she said.Whether you needed a ride, an oil change, brakes replaced or help building something, ""all you had to do was ask, and Jon would do it,"" said Natasha.Lifelong friend of Styres, Sharon Hill, said Styres loved to spend a lot of his time just hanging around her family, walking around with a big grin on his face.

It didn't get far before crashing into the hole.Malcolm has started an investigation into why the road wasn't closed sooner. He's waiting to talk with workers who were busy trying to fix the broken main.Pipe repairs are expected to take several days. Strasburg is closed between Battler and Trillium.It's unusual for a vehicle to drive into a sinkhole caused by a water main break in Kitchener, Malcolm said. The last time he can remember that happening was in the late 1980s.It not unusual for motorists to drive around road closed barriers, endangering workers, he said.In this case, Malcolm understands the truck approached from the opposite side of the break from workers, who had no chance to warn the driver about the water-covered pit.The work truck from TriGreen landscaping had water up to its rooftop as city crews used an industrial pump to drain the sinkhole about 7:30 a.m. The trailer stayed on the road, mostly out of the water.Two tow trucks were waiting to pull out the truck and trail out of the hole.

Then North Korea's KCNA news agency reported Pyongyang was putting the complex under military control and giving its South Korean staff until 5 pm Thursday to get out.Within hours, all the South Korean staff at the Kaesong joint industrial complex, which lies in the communist North, had left, the government in Seoul said.The Kaesong factory estate, only a few kilometers from the heavily militarized border, served as a window to the outside world for the reclusive North and earned scarce foreign exchange for Pyongyang.Some 54,000 low-paid North Koreans work in more than 124 factories, which produce textiles, clothes, household appliances and parts for machines, cars and semiconductors. Their wages were paid directly to the North's government. Construction of the site began in 2004.A statement by Pyongyang's agency for dealings with the south, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK), said: ""It will completely freeze all assets including equipment, materials and products of the South Korean enterprises ...""The persons to be expelled are not allowed to take things out of the zone, except for their personal belongings.""Once they had left, the North's military communication and Panmunjom hotlines to the south were to be cut off, it added.On Jan. 6, North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test since 2006.

I am tired of living here,"" said Fry, who is from Ohio, at one point. ""You guys took away everything from me, for doing nothing wrong.""In a long, confusing rant to online commentator Gavin Seim, Fry complained of his taxes paying for abortions and his marijuana being taken away. He was referring to Ohio voters last year turning down a bill to legalize the sale of marijuana.""I will no longer be a slave to this system,"" he said, growing increasingly agitated.

They walked one by one toward an olive green armored vehicle carrying Graham and Nevada lawmaker Michele Fiore.Holding hands, Sean Anderson, 48, of Riggins, Idaho, and his wife, Sandy, 47, went first, their arms held high. Sean carried an American flag in his right hand. Sandy was patted down by an FBI agent and then taken away. Jeff Banta, 46, of Yerington, Nev., went next.The FBI said the four would be arraigned before a federal judge in Portland on Friday.Graham, at the request of the protesters and the FBI, was in phone contact with the group for the past week to negotiate an end to the standoff. The North Carolina preacher joined Fiore in an armored vehicle to reach the four holdouts.The surrender process capped a five-week ordeal that included the arrest of almost a dozen protesters and the shooting death of one in a confrontation with police.The final act of the drama Thursday morning played out in real time through a phone call streamed online, with Fiore and Graham staying in touch with the protesters. ""America's watching, so nothing is going to happen,"" Fiore said.Before the surrender, Graham also spoke to the group by phone. ""We are proud of you and love you and look forward to giving you guys a big hug,"" Graham said before praying and climbing into a vehicle to drive to the surrender site.""We haven't bathed in a few days so don't be offended,"" Sean Anderson replied.

It is expected to go into effect soon, the person said.The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company has been fighting the E.U. on the breadth of what it must block under European data privacy law for two years.

Twitter timelines are going to be just fine.Users of the social network had worried an algorithm would ruin their feeds, swapping the service's rapid fire feel for something more like a Facebook feed. That fretting reached a fever pitch over the weekend, spawning the popular hashtag #RIPTwitter.The change is here, and judging from an early look at post-algorithm Twitter, it's certainly not as bad as previously thought.Before we dig into the new timeline, let's quickly recap how this all started. Last Friday, Buzzfeed reported Twitter planned on changing timelines, moving away from a reverse-chronological structure (most recent tweets at the top) to an algorithm that would examine who you follow and pick the best tweets you missed. Outrage, well at least on Twitter, was fierce.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later commented timelines would stay as they are and professed his love for ""the live stream."" On Tuesday it announced the changes, which it calls ""Never miss important Tweets from people you follow.""Now that the timelines are rolling out, they're nowhere near as bad as many feared. Basically, the algorithm will move older tweets that it deems valuable higher up on the timeline. It's subtle. Users may first notice a message on their timeline that reads ""never miss an important tweet,"" letting them know the feature is available.(Clarification:In an earlier Periscope, I mention this is connected to Twitter's While You Were Away feature, which highlights important tweets you may have missed while away from the service. That's not correct. The only real way to tell is by viewing the timestamps on a tweet to tell if they've been shifted).Frankly, it's difficult to tell when the algorithm has made any changes, but that could vary depending on how many accounts you follow and other activity. Users finding it disruptive can shut it off. On the web, Twitter users go to settings, then account, then the content section to disable. On mobile, you go to Settings and look for Timeline or Timeline personalization to shut it off.If this is how Twitter's algorithm functions, turning it off might not be necessary.

336,0,"After most health insurers racked up financial losses on Affordable Care Act plans in 2014, many companies' results for last year worsened, creating heavy pressure to improve performance this year.An analysis of filings by not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers- among the biggest players in the law's exchanges for buying individual insurance- shows the challenge facing the industry as it seeks a turnaround in the individual business. They paid out more for health care in the first three quarters of 2015 than they took in from premiums on their individual plans.On Wednesday, Humana Inc. became the latest of the big publicly traded companies to flag problems, saying its losses on individual plans deepened last year. Humana included in its 2015 results $176 million in losses it expects to incur on such plans in 2016.Though the health law has added customers to many insurers' rolls, much of that growth has been unprofitable, reflecting medical costs that have often run ahead of what insurers projected when they set premiums, among other factors.The nonprofit Blues included in the regulatory-filings analysis- which was done by J.P. Morgan- had roughly $20.4 billion in individual-plan premiums over the first three quarters of 2015. Those enrollees incurred about $20.7 billion in medical claims. The result was sharply worse than a year earlier, when the premium total was larger than the claims payout.Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, which estimated it had a loss of $77 million on individual plans for 2015, compared with a $66 million loss in 2014, said the ...overall risk of people buying insurance on the exchanges is much higher than planned for,.. in part because the law hasn't attracted enough healthy enrollees. The insurer said such losses ...cannot be sustained long-term...In an interview, Kevin Counihan, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services unit charged with implementing the health law, said there were many new customers among the 12.7 million people who chose plans during enrollment for 2016, signaling that ...the market is getting stronger; it's going to be increasingly more attractive.. for insurers.In 2014, the year the health law's marketplace plans launched, 70% of insurers lost money on individual plans in the end, McKinsey & Co. calculates.There were some brighter spots; plans in a few states- notably California, which runs its own marketplace- produced profits. Some Medicaid-focused companies, such as Molina Healthcare Inc. and Centene Corp., have been profitable on the exchanges.But for 2015, recent earnings calls by the largest publicly traded insurers- many of which reported strong overall results- have highlighted setbacks with the ACA business. Typically, the ACA plans represent a relatively small share of total revenue. Humana said it ...continues to evaluate its participation in the individual commercial business for 2017... The insurer has agreed to be acquired by Aetna Inc. in a deal awaiting antitrust clearance.UnitedHealth Group Inc. said it had losses of about $475 million on its 2015 ACA-plan business, and booked $245 million of projected 2016 losses as part of 2015 results; it is considering withdrawing from exchanges.Aetna said it saw a negative margin of 3% to 4% in 2015 on individual plans. Anthem Inc., which achieved profits on individual plans in 2014, fell back to roughly break-even in 2015, amid enrollment that came in below what it once expected.The most dramatic signs of strain came from startup cooperative insurers launched by the health law, many of which closed their operations in the wake of losses last year.Among the nonprofit Blues, the results in the state filings likely indicated overall loss margins of around 11% to 16% on individual plans in the first three quarters of 2015, once other expenses were factored in, said Gary Taylor, a J.P. Morgan analyst. He also said medical claims often tick up in the fourth quarter, for which state filings aren't yet public.In explaining losses on individual plans sold on the state health exchanges or the federal one, insurers have complained of higher expenses from consumers who sign up for coverage outside the annual open-enrollment period, often as they appear to need medical care. ...We're starting to see some issues of potential gaming of the system,.. said Eric Earling, a spokesman for Premera Blue Cross. In its main market, Washington state, Premera was 8% in the black for its individual plans in 2014, but it swung to a roughly 6% loss in 2015.Analysts said insurers themselves may have misfired in setting rates too low, either because they were hoping to grab market share or because they had little data on which to base their projections. ...Some of it is based on insurers somewhat aggressively pricing this business,.. said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.The losses put a spotlight on 2016. ...If 2016 is like 2015, we'll have a real problem, because carriers could just start pulling out,.. said Tom Snook, an actuary with consultants Milliman Inc.Many insurers made changes for this year, including significant rate increases and paring of product offerings. Federal regulators have also made tweaks, including more limits on consumers' ability to sign up for coverage outside open enrollment.Mr. Counihan of the federal CMS said regulators are also looking closely at data about the off-season enrollees, and in situations where there ...could be potential abuse, we're going to address that and fix them...Some insurers are projecting improvement this year. Aetna is expecting to break even. Anthem has forecast a positive margin.Other companies, echoing UnitedHealth and Humana, are already worried about 2016. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, which estimates it lost more than $150 million on its individual business in 2015, is projecting a significant loss for 2016, said Roy Vaughn, a spokesman. That would come despite a rate increase of around 36.3% for this year's ACA plans.The insurer will need to seek another rate boost for 2017 ...to try to get us to a level that makes it sustainable,.. Mr. Vaughn said.",20.65,6.62,1.58,5.04,17.89,11.17,2.77,3.16,4.55,2.77,5.43,5.83,0,0.3,0,0,1.78,1,0

The real-life elements aren't always exact, but much revolves around Ms. Allen as Elaine Kendall, a mother struggling to temper a household of endless crisis.Her daughter DeeDee (Iris Gilad) is a developmentally disabled adult whose romantic involvement with a likewise-challenged young black man causes flare-ups at home, mostly with her Irish-American father (Mr. Harney). An older son haunts the household, all but paralyzed by post-traumatic stress disorder from the first Gulf War. Middle sibling Todd (Mr. Rossi) works as a bus driver, but has bigger dreams he is finding hard to realize....I wanted to bring in the idea that people are walking around with a lot more pain than we give them credit for,.. said the director, who compressed three decades of family material into a one-week time frame, set during Christmas week of 1999.That resonated strongly with Mr. Rossi, who recognized similar emotions and circumstances from his Staten Island youth. He also appreciated the story's intimate dramatic perspective, which he likened to films such as ...In the Bedroom.. and ...Blue Valentine......It wants to drag some sort of seesaw emotion out of you,.. he said. ...I was brought to this place where I thought, ...My God, this is like my life.'

Bernie Sanders will meet for their sixth debate on Thursday night in Milwaukee, in a contest set to be carried on PBS and CNN at 9 p.m. EST.It will be their first meeting since Mrs. Clinton's blowout loss in the New Hampshire Democratic primary on Tuesday. The forum also comes as her campaign re-evaluates questions about message, fundraising, and strategy after the 22-point defeat.Mrs. Clinton's campaign argues because the first two primary contests are in states that are whiter and more rural than the country at-large, they expect her to start winning convincingly in March, when states with larger and more diverse populations head to the polls.But Mr. Sanders has shown that he has the financial support to mount a significant challenge that could go well into the spring, despite her lead in the national polls. In the 24 hours after his victory in New Hampshire, he raised more than $6 million online -  a staggering amount of campaign cash in a short period of time.The Democratic primary now moves to the south and the west: to Nevada, where the state's Latino population plays an important role in the state's caucuses and to South Carolina, which as a large black population active in Democratic politics.Here's what both candidates need to do on the debate stage tonight:* * *Hillary ClintonMrs. Clinton has frequently delivered strong performances in each of the previous Democratic forums, but her challenge going forward is to bring Mr. Sanders down to earth.The Sanders campaign is riding a wave of positive media coverage after his New Hampshire finish that points to his strong support across nearly all demographic and income groups, his impressive grass-roots fundraising numbers and his increasing number of endorsements. His campaign message is built around the premise that he's a fearless independent, who is not beholden to interest groups and who doesn't practice politics as usual.Mrs. Clinton will need to aggressively challenge that image and remind Democratic primary voters that Mr. Sanders is a politician -  someone who has made unpopular compromises and cast difficult votes. She's already hammered him on his vote in favor of granting gun manufacturers immunity -  forcing his campaign into an awkward retreat last month. And she showed glimmers of that attack in a debate earlier this month that questioned his progressive credentials. She'll now need to expend on that critique.The other challenge for Mrs. Clinton is to keep her numbers up among African-Americans and Latinos, who will play a huge role in the Democratic primary going forward. She'll likely make her commitment to racial equality and social justice issues a major topic going forward, including from the debate stage.* * *Bernie SandersMr. Sanders has one major challenge in the coming weeks and months: expand his base. He's popular among young people, liberals and white Democrats. Mrs. Clinton has bigger leads among black and Latino voters -  but she's also got nearly universal name recognition. Many Democratic voters are only starting to pay attention to the race.These debates are his best opportunity to expand his coalition and peel away some of Mrs. Clinton's support. He'll need to introduce himself to voters who are just tuning in and explain how his economic vision for the country will help all Americans.Some prominent African-Americans leaders have criticized Mr. Sanders for a narrow focus on economic issues. He'll need to address that perception and speak specifically to the concerns of Latino Americans and African American voters.And he'll need to expand his foreign policy repertoire, especially in debates against a former secretary of state. He routinely brings up Mrs. Clinton's 2002 Iraq War vote -  a deeply unpopular issue among liberals that wins him points on the debate stage. But he'll need to reverse the impression that he's not as fluent or comfortable on foreign policy issues if he wants to be seen as a credible commander-in-chief.",22.93,9.47,5.71,3.76,15.04,11.43,5.86,2.86,6.17,1.35,6.47,2.41,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0
339,0,"The two busiest U.S. ports on Thursday reported slight growth in imports, the latest sign that many companies are holding back on spending as they wait for the economic picture to clear.The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which form the largest port complex in the Western Hemisphere, reported a 37% jump in container imports from a year earlier, when both ports slowed to a crawl amid protracted labor negotiations. Compared to the same period in 2014, the ports' combined volume only grew 1%. Exports were up 5% from last year but down 18% from January 2014.January's volumes show that West Coast ports have largely recovered from last year's congestion. However, growth remains subdued as U.S. retailers and manufacturers have been slow to ramp up imports after the holidays, opting instead to work through large inventories built up last year. The strong dollar has reduced exports by making U.S. goods more expensive in foreign markets. Even so, Los Angeles port officials said it was their busiest January on record....Certainly they bounced back a lot from last year, but in the longer scheme of things, they should hold the champagne,.. said international trade economist Jock O'Connell.Los Angeles imported 367,209 20-foot equivalent units, a standard measure for container cargo, up from 259,206 last January. Long Beach handled 278,491 TEU of imports, up from 213,667 a year prior.Los Angeles exported 126,241 TEU, up from 124,365 last January. Long Beach's 106,739 was an improvement on last year's 98,462.Meanwhile, empty container movement continued to grow. Empties were up almost 25% from January 2014, and more than 37% from this month last year. Long Beach officials attributed the surge in empties to businesses returning containers that had been imported full of ...post-holiday sales.. items, now making the return trip to Asia. The Port of Los Angeles moved 210,949 empty TEUs in January, and the Port of Long Beach moved 150,958.Some Southern California shipping businesses are bracing for an uptick in inbound cargo after the shuttering of the Outer Harbor Terminal in Oakland, that port's second largest of five terminals. The port says it will direct cargo from that terminal to others nearby, but some analysts warn that could add to congestion.However, Mr. O'Connell said much of Oakland's imports are destined for local markets, and trucking them up from Southern California would potentially be too expensive.",20.6,4.13,1.21,2.91,16.02,7.77,3.4,3.16,6.31,0.73,6.55,8.01,0,0,0,0,0.97,1,0
340,0,"Every month for years, Heidi Cornell-McKenna paid $8,000 to her elderly neighbor in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. In exchange, she earned the right to buy the woman's house when she died. Her neighbor died at age 100, and Ms. Cornell-McKenna closed on the house last February.Adam Solomon and his husband ...did a dance for a solid two years.. with their next-door neighbors in Manhattan, with each couple hoping to buy the other out. Mr. Solomon said the Long Island City skyline view from their combined apartments was worth the roughly $15,000 over market value he paid for the place next door.With larger spaces scarce in hot markets, some homeowners are finding creative ways to buy their neighbors' properties, using persistence, charm and detective work to expand their empires without leaving the block....Our neighbors laugh and say ...what were you trying to do- play Monopoly?',.. said Alexa Hampton, a 44-year-old interior designer who, with her husband, successfully purchased two apartments adjacent to their unit to create a roughly 3,500-square-foot spread.The convenience of buying the property next door doesn't come cheap. Purchasers can expect to pay at least 10% above the market rate- and sometimes much more, real-estate agents said. Premiums are especially high in hot property markets like New York City and Los Angeles, where space is hard to come by.In December, actress and writer Tina Fey paid $9.51 million- roughly $2 million over the asking price- for the apartment above hers on New York's Upper West Side. Last year, film producer Megan Ellison, daughter of software billionaire Larry Ellison, plunked down $5.25 million for the house next to her $30 million estate in the Hollywood Hills. And in 2014 nighttime talk show host Jimmy Fallon bought a fifth apartment in his New York City building, where he bought his first unit in 2002.The chase can take years. Mr. Solomon, a 31-year-old agent at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, and his husband longed to buy their neighbors' unit, which shared their view of Long Island City's Pepsi-Cola sign. But the neighbors, a couple with a small child, rebuffed Mr. Solomon's offer to buy it.Then, about a year later, the neighbors turned the tables, offering to buy Mr. Solomon's apartment. He countered, and eventually bought the neighbor's apartment for $915,000, a price he thinks is about $15,000 over market value. After combining the units, he lives in a 1,900-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms, 2Î bathrooms, a den and a laundry room. Best of all, he said, ...every room has the same view...Jeff Thomas also had to be patient. In 2012 Mr. Thomas, a real-estate developer and owner of car dealerships, bought a 4,000-square-foot house with views in Los Angeles's Hollywood Hills for $4.25 million with real-estate agent Paul Blair of the Agency. Mr. Thomas wanted to expand, but found that local laws wouldn't let him unless he had more land.About six months after he moved in, the house next door came on the market. Mr. Thomas put in an offer, but the property sold to a higher bidder for $2.25 million. About two years later, Mr. Thomas approached the owners through a friend and asked them to name their price, then quickly agreed to their ask of $2.7 million.Throughout, Mr. Thomas, 50, kept his identity as their neighbor hidden. ...If they feel they have a captive buyer, who really wants or really needs this property, it's just human nature to try to get as much as they can out of this guy,.. he said. He now plans to demolish both homes and build a 17,350-square-foot house with four bedrooms plus staff quarters, an infinity pool and a roof deck with views. The new home would likely be worth $20 million to $30 million, according to Mr. Blair.Sometimes convincing neighbors to sell requires finding them a new home. ...People get very creative for a little extra square footage,.. said real-estate agent Nada Rizk of Brown Harris Stevens.The Manhattan apartment purchased by actress Tina Fey and her husband in December. The couple paid $9.51 million for the apartment, which is directly above another unit they own.Heidi Cornell-McKenna in the Hollywood Hills home she bought from her neighbor.Soon after buying her house in 2007, Ms. Cornell-McKenna started fantasizing about buying the house next door, with which she shared a driveway, for her mother. ...I had a vision of a compound,.. she said.She got to know her neighbor, a woman in her 90s who had lived there for decades. When the owner's family visited on Sundays, ...I would tell them, ...I would love to have this house one day,'.. Ms. Cornell-McKenna recalled. ...I would love it for my mom...Ms. Cornell-McKenna also worried that someone would tear down the neighbor's house and rebuild. ...It would be awful having to share that driveway with someone tearing down their house,.. she said. ...I would have nightmares thinking, ...someone's going to buy this house.'..The swimming pool and views.But Ms. McKenna wasn't sure she could afford to buy the neighbor's house, and her neighbor needed money to pay her expenses. Eventually they came up with a creative solution: Ms. Cornell-McKenna signed an agreement to buy the house for $2 million, with the understanding that the deal wouldn't close until the owner died. Meanwhile, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would pay the neighbor $8,000 a month, with the payments subtracted from the final purchase price.The arrangement ended working out for everyone: The neighbor got to stay in her home, and when she died two years later, Ms. McKenna was able to close on the house.Royce Pinkwater, founder of the real-estate investment brokerage company Pinkwater Select, described one Manhattan combination she orchestrated last spring as ...the most complicated deal I've ever done in my career... For clients who wanted to expand their three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment, she hired an investigator to find the contact information for the owners of the two-bedroom apartment directly below theirs. To convince the neighbors, an elderly couple, to sell, she had to find them another apartment in the building and offer them $6.5 million, about 20% over market, for their unit. Then after the closing, her clients had to wait months for the couple to renovate their new apartment before moving out.After all that, Ms. Pinkwater's clients changed their minds, and both units are now on the market for a total of $19.25 million.Ms. Cornell-McKenna, 49, founder of the lifestyle brand Young Fabulous & Broke, purchased her Hollywood Hills house, with a view of Century City and the ocean, in 2007. Almost right away she started fantasizing about buying the house next door, with which she shared a driveway, for her mother. ...I had a vision of a compound,.. said Ms. Cornell-McKenna, who at the time was a single mother. About five years ago, she started saving money to purchase the house, creating an LLC called ...1423 Devlin Drive,.. after the property's address.Then her neighbor- a woman in her 90s who Ms. Cornell-McKenna had befriended- looked into getting a reverse mortgage on the home to help pay her expenses, but couldn't get one. In 2012, with advice from Douglas Elliman agent Tracy Tutor Maltas, Ms. Cornell-McKenna signed an agreement to buy the house for $2 million, with the understanding that the deal wouldn't close until the owner died. Meanwhile, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would pay the neighbor $8,000 a month. The payments would be subtracted from the home's price, and when the neighbor died, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would have 60 days to close.The arrangement was ...a risk,.. Ms. Cornell-McKenna said, because she wasn't sure how long the neighbor would live or if she'd have enough money saved when it came time to close. It ended up working out: The neighbor lived for two years before dying at age 100, during which time ...my company did better and better,.. Ms. Cornell-McKenna said. She closed on the home in February of 2015.Real-estate agents caution that bigger isn't always better. Before making plans to combine two properties, buyers should make sure the combination won't create an awkward layout, which can hurt the home's value, said Ms. Pinkwater. ...There are combinations that happen that should never have happened,.. she said. ...It has to make sense...If it works, a combination can provide better value, especially in markets where real-estate values have appreciated rapidly. When Stacy Rauen, 37, editor of Hospitality Design magazine and founder of the prenatal beverage Bump Water, found out she was pregnant with twins in the spring of 2014, she was living in a two-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with her husband and their toddler son. With one new baby, ...we could have made it work,.. she said. ...But not with two of them...They started looking around for larger apartments and were disappointed with the options. ...To get a three or four-bedroom, we were kind of priced out of what we wanted,.. she said.The apartment upstairs seemed like the solution- it was on the market and had the same layout as theirs for an easy combination. But by the time the Rauens found out about the twins, it had gone into contract. So they made an offer on a three-bedroom in another building, which was accepted.Then the unit upstairs fell out of contract. Ms. Rauen's husband knocked on the upstairs neighbor's door one Sunday night and offered to buy the apartment for just under the asking price. The neighbors agreed, and the Rauens retracted their offer on the other apartment. They paid $1.645 million for the unit plus a parking spot and private rooftop patio.After the closing, the Rauens spent about $200,000 to combine the spaces into a four-bedroom duplex with a playroom and a ...mini-mudroom.. with space for two strollers. They finished the week before Ms. Rauen gave birth.Combining the two apartments made getting a mortgage a little more complicated than they expected, she said, which delayed the closing by a few weeks. Another quirk of the setup is that they have two separate electric and cable bills.But because they'd purchased their original apartment in 2011 for $749,000, even with the renovation the total cost was still less than the other apartment they'd made an offer on, which had less living space and fewer amenities.Plus, she added, ...We were able to make something that fit exactly how we wanted to live...",20.63,9.64,6.57,3.06,14.54,11.92,4.35,2.56,4.68,0.45,6.52,7.69,0.17,0,0.06,0,2.62,0,1
341,0,"We've all heard it before: Too many Americans, more than one out of three, are obese, making them more likely to suffer from diabetes, stroke and heart disease.But what can be done about a problem that's so deeply ingrained in our culture? What people eat comes down to a complicated mix of preferences, location, access and behavior.  In New York, Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to outlaw super-size sodas. Several years ago, the Los Angeles City Council banned new fast-food restaurants in parts of the city. The city of Berkeley passed a soda tax. Now, in another attempt to reduce obesity rates, the Los Angeles County Public Health department is launching an advertising campaign to encourage parents and their kids to choose smaller portions and healthier foods the next time they eat out. Though California has the fifth-lowest adult obesity rate in the nation, it has the highest obesity rate among low-income kids ages 2 to 4, with nearly 17% who are obese. Approximately 15% of all California kids are obese, according to national data.L.A. County's campaign message is simple: When eating out, eat less. And it doesn't matter where you're finding your next meal....Everyone points their fingers at fast food,.. said Dr. Paul Simon, the department's director of the Division of Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention, but ...we're missing the boat to some degree when we let other restaurants off the hook...Even meals at sit-down restaurants tend to be packed with calories, salt and fat, he said. The ads, which began running Thursday and will continue through mid-March, will appear in Metro stations and trains, MTA buses, as well as radio stations and on social media, Simon said. They'll be in English and Spanish, with some also in Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese, he said. In one advertisement, a young girl holds a menu, next to ...Tip #1 for eating out: Choose milk or water every time... Another reads: ...Tip #2 for eating out: Choose fruits or veggies on the side...Obesity is one of the biggest battles public health officials face. Rates have skyrocketed in America, from 15% in 1980 to 35% in 2010.High obesity rates among children are particularly worrisome because they're showing signs of diseases once seen only in adults -  diabetes and liver damage -  and they're developing habits that could keep them unhealthy for the rest of their lives, Simon said. ...There's clearly a need to intervene early ... to turn the curve on obesity and diabetes,.. he said. In October, the health department launched a different ad campaign called Water: The Healthiest Choice. In one poster, a young boy sips on a red straw, his face partly covered by the words ...WARNING: Soda, sports & juice drinks can lead to childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes...Experts say there's no easy solution to obesity, which is driven by eating and exercise habits that are closely linked to people's lifestyles. That makes ending the epidemic as much of an uphill battle as tackling smoking was in the 1960s and 1970s, Simon said....The poster child for this is, of course, tobacco, where, over the course of 30 years, we really changed the norms around smoking,"" he said. ""It's going to be very challenging, but we're trying to change those norms around eating patterns as well...The new L.A. County ads don't discriminate between types of restaurants. Research shows that kids consume about a third of their calories outside the home, and that it's not just fast-food restaurants parents need to worry about.One study found that at sit-down chain restaurants, meals contained 1,128 calories on average, more than half of the average daily 2,000-calorie recommendation for an adult. Another study evaluated the calorie totals of meals at small chains and independent eateries, with similar results: too many calories. ...People are consuming far too many calories in a given meal,.. Simon said.He said he knows it can be difficult for restaurant owners to cut back on tasty yet unhealthy ingredients or scale down portion sizes and not lose customers.But Kevin McCarney, founder of Mexican restaurant chain Poquito Mas, said he doesn't view these adjustments as giving customers less, but just giving them more options.In addition to the classic burritos, tacos and tostados sold at Poquito Mas, customers also can buy smaller versions, called ...Petitos......The customer doesn't have to choose between not having a burrito ... and having a burrito and having too much food,.. McCartney said. ...The idea is that sometimes people just want the craving of the food, that flavor, but we don't want all the food...Poquito Mas is one of several establishments designated as ...Choose Health L.A... restaurants by the county health department. The dozens of restaurants that have qualified must offer smaller portion options as well as fruits and vegetables as sides for kids.At a news conference Thursday unveiling the new ad campaign, Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis made a plea to Latino families, who tend to suffer from higher rates of obesity and diabetes.Solis, who represents the San Gabriel Valley and much of East L.A., asked that parents think twice about what they're feeding their kids. Her mother and father, she said, always made sure she had a glass of milk with her meals, and tried to not use too much oil when cooking. ...Those are good things about our culture,.. she said. ...We know that we can do better...",18.8,7.71,3.8,3.91,14.66,13.14,6.08,4.23,6.3,1.52,6.3,7.49,0.87,0,0.11,0,3.26,0,1

Did he take the place by storm? When did you realize he would be president?Honestly? Few people knew him. He kept a low profile for most of his eight years. He was just a new lawmaker in the minority party with zero involvement in the hidden machinations of the Capitol.In conversations Wednesday in his private cabin on Air Force One as he flew to Springfield -  a native son returning to his political roots -  and then later in a chat with three former legislators, Obama said that while America's political culture has grown meaner and more partisan, he has not....It's not like I've changed,.. he said. ...I'm the same guy now that I was then...He added, ...I'm no more cynical. I'm not more ideological. My positions are surprisingly consistent...After he first entered the White House in 2009, he said, ...I would invite a number of Republican senators.._ to come over to the White House for movies or some other events...But increasingly, he complained, ...it was hard for them to do it without getting in trouble.. with others in the GOP.He made clear he missed the anonymity of being a backbencher in a prairie capital, the days when he could drive his beat-up Jeep to the Diary Queen and, as he joked, build up a college fund for his daughters, Malia and Sasha, by fleecing his colleagues in poker....I took them for all they were worth,.. he boasted to laughter.His secret? ...I would just nurse my beer and these guys -  you know. So the longer the game went on, the looser their betting got,.. he claimed.It was also a time when, his friends agreed, he could bring warring political factions together in backrooms to strike a deal, when he wasn't lampooned or lionized by people who didn't know him.The truth is few in the Statehouse took note of Obama during his years here.I came to know him, but only because my newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, was devoted to uncovering flaws in the Illinois capital justice system. Obama, a constitutional lawyer who also focused on the problem, was valuable to us.Still, it took years me to realize he might one day rise in politics -  possibly even to mayor of the city of Chicago. And that insight came only after Democrats took the majority in the state Senate and he began to call some shots.As I traveled and talked with Obama on his return to Springfield, I realized how much his anonymity worked for him then -  and how it informed his view that Americans are not as divided as our politics would suggest.When he sat down with three old friends -  former senators who showed him the ropes in Springfield -  he talked about all they got done outside the public spotlight.They fostered friendships, discussed their daughters and looked for common ground. They didn't become punching bags on cable news or talk radio.After he got to Washington, he recalled, ...I had very good relationships and friendships with some of the same people now who can't take a picture with me. It wasn't like I changed...I listened as they reminisced about passing state laws to reform campaign finance and capital justice. Obama also won bipartisan support for a bill to make police more aware of the role that race may play in law enforcement.I suddenly recalled a moment with Obama outside the Statehouse press room, sometime in 2002. I'd accosted him with a tape recorder to ask about his closed-door meetings with law enforcement officials to talk about racial profiling.He smiled and said he'd let me know when he had something to tell me.I pressed. A liberal black lawmaker from Chicago? Shouldn't he want to vent about the system? Especially to his hometown paper?He dug in. He'd talk to me, I remember him saying, but not then.I stormed off to talk to somebody else.

343,0,"As Mexico prepares for the Friday arrival of Pope Francis, not everyone is looking forward to the visit.How much the trip is costing -  and whether that money would be better spent combating poverty, disease, unemployment and other problems the Pope himself has championed -  has become a vibrant debate in a country where more than 80% of the population is Catholic.One newspaper, Milenio, estimated that state and municipal governments will have spent nearly $10 million by the end of the six-day visit.One Twitter user, Luisa Grisales, cited that estimate in a tweet, saying it would be better spent on education, health and creating jobs.There is an economic upside too, of course, as tourists flock to the stops along the pontiff's path and spend millions of dollars.And the visit won't be entirely funded by the government, as businessman Carlos Slim, the world's second-richest man, and several companies have donated to the cause, according to the magazine Proceso.Still, the hashtag #YoNoQuieroQueVengaElPapa (...I don't want the Pope to come..) has been showing up on Mexican Twitter accounts....Why do we want the pope here? one tweet asked. ""The people can't eat hope... Other critics of the trip wanted to know: Why won't Pope Francis be meeting with victims of sexual abuse by clergy?

Fort Collins' tight market signifies a healthy employment rate and a growing population.""A common theme for cities with low vacancies is a very low unemployment rate, and Fort Collins comes in with half the national average, at just 2.8 percent,"" Blomquist said. ""But Fort Collins is also a college town, and a small one at that, which lends itself to even fewer vacant properties when you have a steady stream of students and employees coming in and providing a supply of buyers and renters.""The report focused on nationwide residential properties based on data such as foreclosure status, owner occupancy status, and equity. California's Silicon Valley, too, logged a 0.2 percent vacancy rate, with about 858 of 443,387 properties open. The report found just 4,424 vacancies among metro Denver's 826,435 total residential properties for a 0.5 percent vacancy rate.Richard Button, the executive director of the Everitt Real Estate Center at Colorado State University, said the existing stock of student-oriented housing in Fort Collins is already sparse, so by extension, the non-student market might begin to reflect it.""In a way, rental is a more affordable way for people who want to live in Fort Collins. Just deciding to live here might mean choosing the rental market,"" Button said. ""What's problematic is the cost of housing here is much higher, so we might also see an out-migration to the surrounding communities because of that increase in pricing.""Blomquist said a ripple effect of the 0.2 percent vacancy rate might mean people having to move further from where they work in order to find housing that's not only available, but also reasonably affordable.""A lower amount of vacant homes is a good thing, but too much of a good thing presents challenges, one of which is affordability,"" Blomquist said.

Those factors, officials said, made checking pressure appear unnecessary and hence it was never done.Griswold's e-mail appears to directly contradict those findings and statements he made to The Denver Post in the days after the disaster when he claimed ""nobody expected (the acid water backed up in the mine) to be that high.""""I personally knew it could be holding back a lot of water and I believe the others in the group knew as well,"" his e-mail said, adding that he was privy to at least some pressure behind the blockage.The e-mail was provided Thursday to The Denver Post and other news outlets as part of a 73-page investigation released by Republican members of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources into the event just outside the town of Silverton.The release sent wastewater carrying possibly more than 880,000 pounds of metals into the Animas River and cascading downstream through three states and two American Indian tribes.""The fatal flaw in the whole plan,"" Griswold wrote, was that when workers began removing parts of the dirt and debris blocking the mine they were operating too low. That opened up a wall of water that could not be stopped.Griswold told The Post his crew's main intention the day of the spill was to work on the adjacent Red and Bonita Mine and that they had just gone to investigate the Gold King.They started to dig away the dirt at the Gold King portal, where, Griswold said, weak rock around the portal had been collapsing. And then the mine blew.""All that was holding it back was the dirt. The dirt just wasn't going to hold,"" Griswold told The Post in the days after the spill.The U.S Department of Interior, in an independent report by its Bureau of Reclamation, said the disaster could have been avoided if the EPA and its contractors used a drill to check wastewater levels inside the mine before digging with heavy machinery to open its clogged portal.It also found the spill resulted from rushing with inadequate engineering know-how.Republicans have been heavily critical of the EPA's internal probe of the spill and the DOI's report, raising questions about bias. The natural resources committee review came after its chair, Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, called for an investigation into the incident under his authority.Bishop, who has long criticized the EPA, said the report by his committee confirms his worries about the previous Gold King inquiries.""This report peels back one more layer in what many increasingly view as a pattern of deception on the part of EPA and DOI,"" he said in a statement Thursday. ""We will need heavier efforts to squeeze out the full truth. The agencies continue to withhold information requested by the committee.""The resources committee report says the DOI, in particular, concealed mistakes by the EPA and has refused to provide key documents from their investigation.Griswold's e-mail too calls into question the interior department's findings. He said specifics in the report about events and actions the day of the spill were inaccurate.""The (report) implies we were in some kind of hurry to open the (mine),"" he wrote. ""This is incorrect there was no hurry or urgency involved.""The EPA and DOI have pushed back against Republican assertions that their probes were incomplete.""We're going to take a look at the report and will respond appropriately,"" Nancy Grantham, an EPA spokeswoman, said Thursday.""Reclamation and its technical service center stand behind our peer-reviewed report,"" said Dan DuBray, a reclamation bureau spokesman.Republican members of Colorado's congressional delegation called the natural resource committee's findings further proof that the EPA has not provided the whole picture on the Gold King spill.Sen. Cory Gardner said he will continue to push for answers.""I've contacted the EPA demanding answers multiple times since it dumped toxic waste into the Animas River more than six months ago, and have received inadequate responses,"" he said. ""It's time for the EPA to be fully transparent and held to the same standards it expects private companies to meet.""Rep. Scott Tipton, whose constituency includes the southwestern Colorado communities hardest hit by the disaster, called for ""severe consequences.""""The EPA has been caught deliberately deceiving the public in order to cover up the fact that it was aware of the risks at the Gold King Mine and yet did nothing, leading to the disaster,"" Tipton said.

With global stocks on the brink of a bear market, trading volumes remain high and volatility is on the rise.""Energy companies have passed the ball to financials, because that's where they get their money,"" said John Manley, who helps oversee about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. ""When problems spring up anywhere, they inevitably find their way back to the financial sector.""The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose 8.6 percent Thursday to 28.56, on the way to a five-month high. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX has jumped more than 56 percent this year.The U.S. earnings season hasn't provided much of a relief even though more than three-quarters of companies that have reported so far have exceeded analysts' profit estimates. Some 21 members of the S&P 500 are scheduled to release financial results today, including American International Group Inc. and CBS Corp. Analysts estimate S&P 500 earnings fell 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter, and will continue to contract in the following two periods.While the S&P 500's valuation of 15.1 times the forecast earnings of its members is in line with the average of the past five years, the measure has plunged 13 percent since the start of the year and is at the lowest level since October 2014. The gauge remains more expensive than developed markets in Europe, where the Stoxx 600 Index trades for 13.4 times estimated earnings.All of the S&P 500's 10 main industries fell Thursday, with financial and industrial shares down more than 2 percent. Phone and consumer discretionary companies were the only groups losing less than 0.5 percent.Banks in the benchmark are down 3.9 percent, headed toward the biggest one-day drop in more than five months. The group has lost nearly 12 percent this month, on pace for the worst in more than five years.Losses in Boeing weighed on industrial shares in the S&P 500 as well as the Dow. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the company properly accounted for the costs and expected sales of two of its best known jetliners, according to people with knowledge of the matter. General Electric Co. and Union Pacific Corp. lost at least 3.4 percent.Cisco Systems Inc. rallied 10 percent, the most since May 2013, after predicting sales that may beat some analysts' estimates. The gains helped blunt some of the pain in the Nasdaq Composite. Also helping, Tesla Motors Inc. added 6.4 percent after assurances that it's on track with development of its long-awaited Model 3, while TripAdvisor Inc. surged 16 percent on a better-than-estimated quarterly profit. Expedia Inc. jumped 8.3 percent after forecasting earnings would grow as much as 45 percent this year.",18.29,4.21,0.63,3.58,17.14,9.15,4.1,2.42,8.73,2.73,6.83,3.79,0.11,0,0,0,0.84,1,0

The firearm homicide rate among black men aged 20-29 is about 89 per 100,000.

For a start, if you're going to take someone out, you need to do it without others knowing you were responsible, and although the Boris Johnson hit had the fingerprints of Osborne all over the knife, we only saw Gove digging the dagger in.There are also elements of class involved within the murderous fight to the top, where Johnson's Eton class is deemed above that of Gove, it is seen as inconceivable to have him brought down by the lower Gove. This naturally did not play well in the scheme of things.Michael Gove will most probably have ample time to think during his summer holiday with his friend George Osborne and their respective families.We are now stuck with a Theresa May candidate who will probably not trigger Article 50 and is a Remainer, and Andrea Leadsom, who we know very little about apart from her soft stance towards a Brexit that may never actually happen and a dubious CV.The dangers of referenda is that they are at risk of events that occur after they happen. We have seen numerous times where referendums in Europe have been overturned or derailed by the political class, and as soon as Cameron resigned he calculated there would be upheaval thus resulting in an opportunity to ruin the EU referendum result and halt a Brexit.As far as we can see, there will not be a Brexit anytime soon, simply for the reason that there are no candidates who will exercise it.

388,0,"Jeremy Corbyn will be automatically included on the ballot paper in Labour's upcoming leadership election, the party's ruling body decided in a nail-biting vote tonight.But the move was immediately slammed by one of Tony Blair's former special advisers who said it signalled 'the end of the Labour party'.The National Executive Committee (NEC) voted 18-14 in favour of the incumbent leader going forward onto the ballot without requiring nominations from MPs and MEPs after Angela Eagle received the necessary nominations to challenge him for the leadership yesterday.The crucial meeting, which is likely to define the future of the Labour party, lasted for nearly six hours as 32 NEC members debated conflicting legal advice on the party's ambiguous rules. It means Mr Corbyn will go head-to-head against Ms Eagle in a leadership election over the summer, with the party's 500,000 members, affiliated union members and registered supporters deciding who they want as leader.Mr Corbyn said he was 'delighted' to be automatically included on the ballot and pledged to campaign 'on all the things that matter'.But John McTernan, who worked for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's government, told the BBC: 'This is the end of the Labour party.'Mr McTernan added: 'Today was the day the Labour party was stabbed in its heart and killed by the Labour party National Executive Committee.'Jeremy Corbyn may well have won this vote but he has destroyed the Labour party.' Labour rebels - who desperately hoped the NEC would rule against Mr Corbyn being automatically on the ballot paper - are considering a legal challenge against tonight's decision. But any legal challenge is likely to fail as the NEC is the party's highest constitutional authority and is given ultimate power on the party's ambiguous rules.As jubilant supporters cheered Mr Corbyn, he told reporters: 'I'm sure Labour MPs will understand that the party has to come together in order to present to the British people the options of a different and better way of doing things.'Meanwhile, the NEC also agreed that the one-off payment to allow registered supporters a vote in the leadership contest will be Σ25 - up from Σ3 previously.It means those who have signed up after Tuesday, January 12, including the claimed 100,000 new members the party says they have attracted since the referendum, will not eligible to vote. But they can still take part if they're willing to pay the Σ25 fee.The decision to introduce registered supporters was made during Ed Miliband's time as leader of the Labour party and is widely credited with helping Mr Corbyn to win last September's leadership vote.Tonight's decision could ultimately split the Labour party into two if Mr Corbyn wins the leadership election, as expected. With 172 Labour MPs opposed to his leadership, Mr Corbyn could find it impossible to lead the official Opposition.  Mr Corbyn's chances of being allowed onto the ballot paper automatically looked all but over earlier after the 32 people in the NEC meeting voted in favour of holding a secret ballot on the decision. Jeremy Corbyn arrives at the Labour party's HQ this afternoon for a meeting of the party's ruling National Executive Committee, which will decide whether he automatically gets onto the ballot paper for the leadership election Angela Eagle received the 51 nominations from MPs and MEPs yesterdayIt would have meant he would have needed to win the backing of 51 Labour MPs and MEPs, which would be a tough task after all but 40 MPs signed a vote of no confidence on his leadership last month. Mr Corbyn - who was allowed to vote himself today - had threatened to take legal action against the NEC if it refused to allow him on the ballot paper. But confirming the decision to allow Mr Corbyn to contest the leadership election without having to win nominations, a Labour spokesperson said: 'The NEC has agreed that as the incumbent Leader Jeremy Corbyn will go forward onto the ballot without requiring nominations from the Parliamentary Labour Party and the European Parliamentary Labour Party. 'All other Leadership candidates will require nominations from twenty percent of the PLP and EPLP.' Ms Eagle said: 'I'm glad the NEC has come to a conclusion. I welcome the contest ahead and I am determined to win it.' As members of the NEC moved on to the crucial decision over whether to allow Mr Corbyn onto the ballot paper, the chairman Paddy Lillis from the Usdaw union, asked Mr Corbyn the room. Today was the day the Labour party was stabbed in its heart and killed by the Labour party National Executive CommitteeJohn McTernan, Tony Blair's former special adviser But he initially refused to budge, according to reports of the chaotic and tense meeting which is taking place on the eighth floor of Labour's HQ on Victoria Street in St James' Park.  Although Mr Corbyn's supporters are confident of winning the leadership election, there is growing evidence that his support among union members is fading, despite union leaders - including Unite general secretary Len McCluskey - publicly endorsing Mr Corbyn.Fewer than a third of Labour-affiliated union members think he should lead the party into the next general election, 58 per cent want him to quit before the next election, while 45 per cent want him out immediately. The poll, conducted by YouGov for the Election Data website signals a key source of Mr Corbyn's support in the party is dying. The survey paints a damning picture of how union members view Mr Corbyn's performance as leader, with an astonishing two thirds saying he is doing a  bad job and 76 per cent believing he is unlikely to ever become prime minister. But his allies are confident enough Labour party members and registered supporters - who can sign up for a vote in the leadership election for just Σ3 - support Mr Corbyn to return him as leader. In an early sign of how nasty the upcoming leadership contest is set to be, Ms Eagle's constituency office was bricked overnight - just hours after she challenged Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership yesterday.  Merseyside police have been informed about the incident, which smashed a window of her Wallasey constituency in the Wirral. Staff are refusing to answer phones in her office because they are receiving so much abuse, while barriers have been erected outside Labour party headquarters in preparation for angry demonstrations later today. Taking a swipe at Mr Corbyn's promise last summer for a 'new, kinder politics,' Ms Eagle said this afternoon: 'These attacks are unacceptable, as is the bullying. It's got to stop, Jeremy's got to call it out, we've got to have a kinder, gentler politics in reality, not just a slogan.' The NEC was sent conflicting legal advice over Mr Corbyn's position, with Labour-commissioned analysis stating that he needed the nominations, but Unite-backed advice from Michael Mansfield QC concluding that he did not because he is a sitting leader.The battle could still end up in the courts, with Mr Corbyn vowing to fight any exclusion from the ballot paper but the anti-Corbyn camp weighing up a legal challenge if he was allowed to stand without the nominations.Solicitors acting for Jim Kennedy, a trade union member of the NEC, have written to party general secretary Iain McNicol warning they will take 'injunctive action' unless Mr Corbyn is automatically on the ballot.The letter from Martin Howe states: 'Our clients are very concerned that the purpose of the special meeting is to manufacture a situation whereby Jeremy Corbyn's name will be omitted from the leadership ballot. That is wholly unacceptable.'Any attempt to keep Jeremy Corbyn's name off the ballot for leader, whilst he remains leader, in light of the current challenge by Angela Eagle (or any other challenger) will be met with legal action for breach of contract, specifically for breach of the 2016 Rule Book Chapter 4 Rule 2Bii.'We put you on the clearest notice that we will be instructed to apply to the High Court for immediate injunctive relief should Jeremy Corbyn's name not go forward automatically to the ballot.'The solicitors warn that the case for Mr Corbyn's automatic inclusion on the ballot is 'so patent and clear' that they are ready to pursue Mr McNicol personally for costs if he is not. Asked whether she believed Mr Corbyn should automatically get onto the ballot paper, Ms Eagle said this afternoon: 'That's a matter for Labour's ruling executive and I believe they're meeting now.' Dennis Skinner is also a member of the National Executive Committee, which is meeting this afternoon to decide whether Jeremy Corbyn automatically gets onto the ballot paper for the leadership election Dennis Skinner is also a member of the National Executive Committee, which is meeting this afternoon to decide whether Jeremy Corbyn automatically gets onto the ballot paper for the leadership election The YouGov poll is significant because 12 of the NEC seats - around a third - are taken up by union representatives. A defiant Mr McCluskey - a close ally of Mr Corbyn - insisted the rules were clear that when there was no vacancy for the leadership - as at present - it was the only the challenger who was required to get 51 nominations. He said it would be a 'sordid little fix' if Mr Corbyn was excluded from the ballot paper.'I think that it would be alien to the traditions of the Labour Party. It would be alien to the concept of natural justice that Jeremy Corbyn is not automatically on the ballot paper,' he told the Today programme. Ms Eagle, who met the 51 nominations threshold yesterday, launched her leadership challenge by declaring Labour needed 'a strong woman' in charge and dismissed links to unpopular moves by previous Labour governments.'I'm not a Blairite. I'm not a Brownite. I'm not a Corbynista. I am my own woman, a strong Labour woman,' she insisted. Ms Eagle, who served as shadow business secretary and shadow first secretary of state in Mr Corbyn's frontbench until last month, promised to make Labour electable again after the 'howl of pain' expressed in the Brexit vote by people who felt they had been ignored for too long.And she insisted it was time for Labour to have a woman leader, amid reports that former frontbencher Owen Smith could launch a rival leadership challenge.'The Conservatives have their second woman prime minister. The Labour Party, the party of equality who pioneered anti-discrimination - it's about time they had their first elected woman leader,' she told Channel 4 News. But this morning she was forced to deny she is too emotional to lead the country after acknowledging she had 'shed a little tear' in interviews after walking out of the shadow cabinet in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership. 'I tried for nine months to fulfil my promise to Labour Party members to try to make Jeremy Corbyn's leadership work and it was just emotion that I had been unable to deliver that,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.'There is more than one way to be a leader and I think being in touch with your emotions is quite important.'It was a difficult day. Politicians ought to be human beings and leaders can be human beings.'The issue here is whether you have got a vision for the country, whether you can provide strong leadership to unite the Labour Party and heal our country in these dangerous times. I believe I have got all of those qualities.'She dismissed a warning from Unite trade union general secretary Len McCluskey that the rebels seeking to oust Mr Corbyn would be branded with the 'mark of infamy' for mounting a 'squalid coup'.'To be honest, Len sounds a bit like he's gone to too many am-dram performances,' she said. Meanwhile, deputy leader Tom Watson told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) that his abandoned peace talks with union leaders failed to find a way around the impasse between MPs and pro-Corbyn elements of the party.He said: 'For years I've been told I'm a fixer. Well, I've tried to fix this, I've really, really tried, and I've failed. I've tried to find a way forward for the party between two apparently irreconcilable decisions.'Clearly the vast majority of the PLP has already made it clear they wouldn't countenance a settlement that involved Jeremy staying in place.'Labour's civil war intensified after the EU referendum when 172 of the party's MPs indicated that they had no confidence in Mr Corbyn in a vote in which he garnered the support of just 40 Westminster colleagues.",2134,28.45,8.01,4.4,14.1,12.89,3.98,2.2,3.7,1.5,3.51,3.23,0.42,0,0,0,0,1,0

Urinals have not been done before mainly for cultural reasons. Its our airline customers who decide on the configuration of the planes they buy....There has been developments in the way space is used and one design involved placing two toilets next to each other with a partition that can be removed to give more space to a handicapped passenger.'Airbus is seeking to take the initiative having suffered problems last year with the production on its A350 jets due to delays in installing toilets.It had warned it might miss target for 15 A350 deliveries because Zodiac had failed to deliver lavatories.At the time Zodiac Aerospace boss Olivier Zarrouati was forced to say delays in delivering onboard toilets would take only a ""ew months' and he had to introduce a new assembly line in Canada to support an increase in production.In the past Airbus has looked at a number of different ways to maximise space.More than 10 years ago it looked at stand-up seats that meant passengers perched rather than sat.This was something budget airline Ryanair had considered.The Irish airline had previously mooted the idea of charging a pound for customers to use the lavatory which it later dismissed as a joke.",422,21.1,6.87,1.18,18.48,16.59,3.79,1.9,4.5,2.37,4.74,2.13,0,0,0,0,0.71,1,0

Staff at Sainbury's have also been praised for giving then woman her shopping for free. One social media user, Jason Stonier said: 'Well done coppers. At the end of the day - we all bleed the same colour.'Well done Sainbury's staff, very kind of you to pay for the lady's shopping.'Another poster, Meg North, commented: 'A delightful story of a caring police officer helping a confused elderly lady.'Justine Lowans said: 'Lovely story, nice to know there is usually someone who will help and look out for others!'

391,0,"Theresa May is preparing to promote a string of female Conservative colleagues, including into key cabinet positions, after she is invited by the Queen to form a new government on Wednesday.Allies including Amber Rudd, currently the energy secretary, and Justine Greening, the international development secretary, are among those expected to be in line for prominent positions as the second female prime minister shakes up the team running the government.The incoming prime minister will announce the reshuffle on Wednesday after she moves into Downing Street with her husband, Philip. May will take up residence at No 10 after an audience at Buckingham Palace where the Queen will confirm her new role.Cameron will face the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in the House of Commons for one final prime minister's questions before making his outgoing remarks on Downing Street. Sometime thereafter he will head to the palace to formally resign. May will make the opposite journey, meeting the Queen for the tradition of ...kissing hands.., which usually involves a handshake. She will make her first speech as Britain's 54th prime minister as she makes her way into Downing Street.The appointments are intended to create a more gender-balanced cabinet, which has been called for by campaigners as a way to improve policymaking. Some of the most senior roles in the cabinet will be occupied by women. ...It was Theresa who set up the campaign to elect more female MPs to parliament, and she has always believed that there should be more women in prominent government positions,.. said a spokeswoman for May.Speculation in Westminster suggested that a woman could be under consideration for the role of chancellor for the first time, although the frontrunners so far include the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and Chris Grayling, leader of the House of Commons. Cameron had made some progress with the gender balance during previous reshuffles, with his final senior team having seven women serving as full members, almost a third of the total. But May intends to go further: other women tipped for ministerial promotions include Harriett Baldwin, Margot James and Karen Bradley, who worked with May at the Home Office as head of the modern slavery bill.On Monday, May delivered a speech about social justice that included an attack on the government's industrial strategy, widely interpreted as a swipe at George Osborne. Some were suggesting that he could be moved from the Treasury to the Foreign Office.Officials within the Home Office suggested Grayling could become home secretary, although Rudd is considered a contender to succeed May in taking responsibility for immigration policy.It was unclear whether May would keep Michael Gove in his job as justice secretary following a number of clashes under Cameron's premiership. However, she is likely to try to unify a party divided by the EU referendum campaign and appoint some senior Brexit campaigners such as Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, Andrea Leadsom and Priti Patel alongside Grayling.Cameron will bow out and make a speech in which he will hope to cement a legacy beyond the EU referendum, and will urge May not to drop the commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on international aid.May's spokeswoman said work was already under way to set up a new department dedicated to negotiating Britain's exit from the EU. ...Civil servants have already been charged with finding a building to house the Brexit department ( an indication of Theresa's commitment to get on with delivering the verdict of the EU referendum. Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it,.. she has said.The prime minister in waiting spent her final day as home secretary planning her entry into Downing Street and also addressing staff at the Home Office. She highlighted areas of policy reform including measures against terrorism and the investigatory powers bill, also known as the snooper's charter.May then told civil servants she believed the ...social justice agenda.. had been at the heart of her tenure, naming inquiries into the Hillsborough tragedy, undercover policing and child sex abuse as proud achievements. Telling officials that ...there will always be a little bit of the Home Office inside me.., May said her department had focused on the most vulnerable in society.May is expected to make the life chances strategy ( a cross-government policy that Cameron hoped would be his flagship reform had he carried on as prime minister ( a priority for the new government. The strategy is being led by the Department for Work and Pensions and includes reforms that affect a child's earliest years, including access to high-quality childcare, a focus on schooling, university, rehabilitation for offenders and work opportunities.Lauding the policy in cabinet, May then told Cameron that he had the ...warmth and respect.. of colleagues, and that he had led the country through a difficult time, with particularly tough economic circumstances.Later, the incoming prime minister went to Conservative headquarters and told staff that it was ...an honour and a privilege to be the new leader of this great party... She thanked staff for their work and set out her priorities. ...Now, more than ever, we need to work together, to deliver on Brexit, to build a country that works for everyone, and to truly unite our party and our country,.. she said, attacking Labour as a party that had brought the country to bankruptcy.In combative language, May claimed it did not matter whether Tony Blair, Gordon Brown or Jeremy Corbyn led the Labour party, because ...when Labour prospers the country suffers...During her time as home secretary and as part of the coalition, May clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, particularly over the controversial snooper's charter and other anti-terrorism legislation.Alex Dziedzan, who worked for Clegg as an adviser, said: ...There were lots of disagreements between Theresa May and the Liberal Democrats on asylum, immigration and issues involving human rights....But she is the toughest negotiator I have ever seen and she was the most formidable person we ever came across in government without a shadow of a doubt. I expect her to be much more forceful in delivering her policies than Cameron ever has been...James Cleverly, the Tory MP for Braintree, said he suspected it would be a ...balanced cabinet.., arguing there were able people who satisfied a number of demographics. ...Then you can stop thinking about tick-box exercises,.. he said.",1076,26.9,7.16,4.37,16.08,13.29,5.76,2.51,5.2,1.39,3.72,5.67,0.19,0,0,0,2.32,0,0
392,0,"A head-on collision between two trains in southern Italy left at least 25 people dead and dozens more injured, authorities said.The trains crashed on a single stretch of track through an olive grove between the towns of Corato and Andria in Puglia on Tuesday....Tears and pain for the victims and their families. But also a lot of anger. We demand clarity on what happened in Puglia this morning,.. said Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi. He cut short a visit to Milan to travel to Puglia.Three carriages were torn apart by the impact between the two trains, which had been travelling down a single-track line in Italy's south-eastern Puglia region.Rescue operators warned the death toll could rise as some of the roughly 50 injured were in serious condition.Authorities urged blood donors to go to local hospitals.The crash happened at around 11.30am on a hot summer's day. Commander Giancarlo Conticchio of the railway police told Sky TG24: ...Surely one of the two trains shouldn't have been there. And surely there was an error,.. he said. ...We need to determine the cause of the error......It looks like there has been a plane crash,.. said the mayor of Corato, Massimo Mazzilli, who published photos of firemen working through the wreckage.Luca Cari, a spokesman for the fire brigade, said they recovered a young boy alive from the wreckage.Each train was made up of four carriages. An aerial image showed carriages smashed and crumpled by the collision, and debris spread out on either side of the track. Four carriages were left standing upright on the rails, a fifth had jumped off the tracks, and the other three appeared destroyed.A police officer at the crash site said passengers were calling for help and crying. ...A horrific scene, unbelievable,.. he told Rai News. ...The worst scene of my life...In the aftermath of the crash a number of survivors sat under olive trees next to the carriages. ...I went barefoot under the wreckage. I dug my way out under the metal pieces and was able to save my husband. I saw people in pieces,.. one survivor told Telesveva.One man said he had been listening to music when the crash happened. ...At a certain point I found myself on the floor and I immediately got up. I saw the train conductor who was on the floor,.. he said, adding that it was five minutes before he was able to escape from the train.Italy's transport minister, Graziano Delrio, was due to travel to Puglia and dispatched two government officials to examine the crash site.Renzi's comments were echoed on Twitter by the speaker of Italian parliament, Laura Boldrini, who said: ...Close to the families of victims and those injured in the head-on train crash in Puglia. I hope that there will soon be clarity on the cause of the disaster...The EU's commissioner for transport, Violeta Bulc, expressed her condolences online and said she was following the situation closely.The stretch of track is operated by a private regional rail company, Ferrotramviaria, which has not yet commented on the incident.The last major rail disaster in Italy was in 2009 when a freight train derailed in Viareggio, in the centre of the country.

393,0,"A Tory-dominated committee of MPs has delivered a scathing critique of radical government proposals to reform children's services, saying they fail to tackle the core problems faced by social workers and could make services worse.The Commons education select committee said key parts of the Children and Social Work bill, currently being debated in the House of Lords, contained significant weaknesses and were potentially detrimental to the social work profession.It attacked ministers' focus on structural reforms and said improvements in services were more likely to come from concentrating on the basics, such as reducing social worker caseloads and preventing experienced professionals from quitting the profession.Ministers have argued that the performance of failing social work departments can best be improved by introducing academy school-style reforms taking them out of local authority control, thereby freeing them from regulations that supposedly crush innovative ways of working.But the committee report said government should not push ahead with such changes until there was evidence they worked. ...Interventions for poorly performing children's services should focus less on unnecessary structural change and more on giving local authorities appropriate support...The committee said ministers had rushed into the reforms and had failed to properly develop the proposals with experts in the sector. It called on ministers to abandon plans to set up a new social work regulator and instead help the profession set up a new independent standards body.The committee chairman, Neil Carmichael, said: ...The government's new reforms do not focus enough on tackling the endemic retention problems in children and families' social work, and ministers must now make it a priority to fix this issue....Improving post-qualifying prospects, increasing the voice of social workers at a national level, and changing the ...blame culture' persistent in social work are important steps which can be driven forward by a strong professional body,.. the Tory MP added.It called on government to impose limits on social worker caseloads and cut high vacancy rates. It heard evidence that ...the negative rhetoric from central government about social workers and the fear of being blamed for mistakes was contributing to high stress and low morale in the workforce...The attack by MPs came as peers in the House of Lords warned they would vote down a controversial proposal in the bill that would enable councils to opt out of a raft of legal duties to vulnerable children on the grounds that they hinder alternative methods of working.Lord Watson, Labour's education spokesperson, told ministers on Monday evening that there was ...deep-seated resentment and opposition.. among Labour, Liberal Democrat and cross-bench peers to the proposals to side-step children's legal rights contained in clause 15 of the bill.Labour is concerned that clause 15 is a backdoor way of introducing for-profit providers into child protection and diluting long-held children's legal rights, allowing the government to resuscitate earlier failed attempts to open up core child protection functions to the market.Lord Warner, a former Labour health minister and now an independent peer, speculated that clause 15 was a ...short-cut way of outsourcing whole chunks of services.. while the crossbencher and former inspector of prisons Lord Ramsbotham called it ...a classic example of regulation too far...Responding for the government, education minister Lord Nash said the government had no intention to change regulations to allow profit-making in children's social care or of using clause 15 to circumvent that position.A Department for Education spokesperson said: ...We agree with the education select committee that social work is one of our most important public services and that work is needed to improve its quality....Excellent social work transforms lives ( that's why the government has invested over Σ700m in training and recruitment; why we have committed a further Σ200m to innovation projects intended to increase the quality of social care practice, and why we intend to accredit every children and family social worker in the country to a high standard...",664,34.95,4.67,1.51,15.21,9.64,4.37,1.96,3.77,3.77,2.86,2.86,0.3,0.15,0,0,2.56,0,0
394,0,"Barack Obama on Tuesday paid tribute to the five officers killed in Dallas last week, as he insisted that racial discrimination still existed in the US and protesters against police violence could not be dismissed as ...troublemakers or paranoid...Angry citizens, for their part, must acknowledge the dangers police face on the job, the president said at an interfaith memorial service for Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Patrick Zamarripa and Brent Thompson, the officers killed by Micah Johnson at a rally against police violence on Thursday night.Obama called for action to stop the conflict between police and protesters and black and white, admitting previous approaches, including his own, are failing....I'm not naive. I have spoken at too many memorials in the course of this presidency,.. Obama said. ...I've seen how inadequate words can be at bringing about lasting change. I see the inadequacy of my own words...He added: ...I understand how Americans are feeling. But, Dallas, I'm here to say we must reject such despair. I'm here to insist that we are not as divided as we seem...Speeches following a mass shooting have become, in some ways, the hallmark of Obama's presidency. A month ago he spoke in Orlando, Florida, following the massacre of 49 club-goers there. Last year, after a gunman shot nine people dead in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, the president sang Amazing Grace. Following the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting he told the nation: ...We're going to have to come together...The president faced a doubly difficult task in Dallas, however, as he navigated two intersecting social fault lines: gun violence in America, and the rising confrontation between police and the people they are meant to protect, particularly African Americans.Those problems, alongside drug addiction and mental illness, are beyond the capabilities of police, he said. He drew a long and loud round of applause when he agreed with a sentiment expressed previously by Dallas police chief David Brown: ...We ask police to do too much,.. Obama said, ...and we ask too little of ourselves...The foe, he said, was not people who held opposing views or attended protests. But rather, ...business as usual. Inertia. Old habits. Expediency...Those tendencies, he said, lead to ...oversimplification that reduces whole categories of our fellow Americans not just to opponents but to enemies...The oversimplification cut both ways, he said. Police must acknowledge that every institution, include police departments, is vulnerable to racism and bigotry. At the same time, he said, people on the other side of the argument must recognize the nature of policing dangerous neighborhoods where officers are required to make instant decisions....We know there is evil in his world,.. he said. ...It's why we need police departments...But centuries of subjugation, of slavery, of Jim Crow segregation, did not stop in the 1960s, he said. ...Race relations have improved dramatically in my lifetime,.. he said. ...Those who deny it are dishonoring the struggle. But, America, we know that bias remains. We know it .._ We have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some time .._ If we're honest perhaps we've heard prejudice in our own heads or felt it in our own hearts. We know that...And some feel to a far greater extent ...discrimination's sting.., he said. ...No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police department. We know this...He added: ...Study after study shows that whites and people of color experience the criminal justice system differently...Dismissing those who point that out as ...a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism.. ( ...it hurts ... Surely we can see that ( all of us......Even those who dislike the phrase Black Lives Matter, surely we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterling's family,.. Obama said, or appreciate that Philando Castile's life ...mattered to people of all races, of all ages... He was referring to two black men shot dead by police last week in Louisiana and Minnesota. On board Air Force One en route to Dallas on Tuesday, the president phoned relatives of the two men.He called on listeners to worry less about which side they were on and ...more about joining sides to do right...The president also paid tribute to each of the dead officers, sketching out personal details about each one.Ahrens ...bought dinner for a homeless man.. the night before he died. Krol ...came a thousand miles from his home state in Michigan to be a cop in Dallas... Smith was a churchgoer who played softball with his two girls. Zamarripa had ...dreamed of being a cop.. and liked to post photos with kids on social media. Thompson was married two weeks ago, his and his wife's ...whole life together waiting before them......Like police officers across the country, these men and their families shared a commitment to something larger than themselves,.. the president said.When anyone thinks ...all police are biased or bigoted, they undermine those people who are acting for our safety.., he said. And those calling for violence against the police ...do a disservice to the cause of justice they claim to promote...He praised Dallas PD as a department that had been at the forefront of improving relations between police and the community, and said that in the aftermath of the shooting, Mayor Mike Rawlings and police chief Brown, ...a white man and a black man, with different backgrounds, working not just to restore order .._ but working together to unify the city, with strength and grace and wisdom...Earlier, Brown was cheered and given a standing ovation as he recalled how as a teenager he would try to communicate with girls using Stevie Wonder lyrics, and then recited the lyrics of Wonder's 1977 hit As, telling the mourners: ...I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky .._ I'll be loving you always......Chief Brown, I'm so glad I met Michelle first, because she loves Stevie Wonder,.. responded Obama to laughter and applause as he took the lectern.Dallas police chief recites Stevie Wonder in memory of officersFormer president George W Bush, who lives in Dallas, struck a note of conciliation and hope in his speech, and offered a word of admiration for law enforcement....Their courage is our protection,.. he said. The police of Dallas, he said, have been ...mighty inspirational to the rest of the nation...Several times Bush compared Dallas and Texas to one enormous family. ...Most of us imagine that if it were called for we would risk our lives for a spouse or child,.. he said. The difference for police officers, he said, is that they risk their lives for strangers.Bush called for more public unity, decrying the state of conflict between activists and police, right and left, black and white. ...Argument turns too quickly into animosity,.. he said.The crowd got to its feet and applauded when he said, ...We judge others by their worst examples, while judging ourselves by our best intentions...First lady Michelle Obama, former first lady Laura Bush, vice-president Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden all also attended the memorial.Obama will also meet the families of the policemen and others who were wounded, the White House said. And on Wednesday he will host a meeting with law enforcement officials, activists and civil rights leaders to discuss ways to repair ...the bonds of trust.. between communities and police.The memorial will be one of a series throughout the week in Dallas. Before Obama's arrival, the citizens of Dallas turned out in their thousands on Monday night to pay tribute to the five dead officers.Obama told senior law enforcement officials on Monday that he saw the Dallas shooting as a hate crime, or one motivated by bias, said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, who was in the closed-door meeting at the White House.Pasco said Obama drew parallels between the actions of the Dallas shooter and the Charleston killings, which prosecutors have said were perpetrated by a man who espoused white supremacist beliefs, Dylann Roof. Johnson, who was black, said that he wanted to ...kill white people.., particularly police, according to a police account of their unsuccessful negotiations with him.White House officials on Tuesday did not dispute Pasco's account of the meeting.

395,0,"The government's Prevent strategy aimed at combating homegrown terrorism is stifling freedom of expression within the classroom and risks being counterproductive, a human rights report warns.Children as young as four are being wrongly identified as having been radicalised simply because of the way they pronounce words or because of clothes they wear, the study by Rights Watch UK alleges. Its release on Wednesday coincides with the publication of a study by Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, which warns that many further education colleges and private training providers are failing to comply with the government's anti-radicalisation programme, leaving students vulnerable to exposure to extremism.In nearly half the institutions inspected, Ofsted found colleges lacked the policies to deal with student access to extremist websites through their computing networks, while others failed to check or monitor external speakers as required by Prevent.While 22 colleges and providers visited by Ofsted had properly implemented the procedures required, another 13 providers were barely meeting the regulations. Two private providers had failed to implement any parts of Prevent, despite their legal obligations to do so since September last year.The two reports adopt opposed views on the benefits of Prevent in schools and colleges. The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, promoted by Theresa May's Home Office, requires teachers from the childcare sector up to university to identify apparent signs of student extremism and refer youngsters to the government's deradicalisation programme, known as Channel.The Rights Watch investigation suggests it is counterproductive, driving children to discuss terrorism, religion and identity issues outside the classroom and online where simplistic ( and jihadist ( narratives go unchallenged.Among new cases highlighted by the report, entitled Preventing Education? Human Rights and UK Counter-Terrorism Policy in Schools, is that of an eight-year-old Muslim child from east London who was ...referred for intrusive questioning without his parents present.. because of an apparent misidentification of an Arabic name on his T-shirt. It carried the name Abu Bakr al-Siddique, an early convert to Islam, but was misread by school staff as being a reference to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State. After the incident, Rights Watch said, the child was reluctant to return to school or engage in classes. In another incident, a 16-year-old from Hampshire with special needs was referred to Prevent after borrowing a book on terrorism from the school library. The teenager's mother was asked questions by Prevent officials about whether he was being radicalised. She told Rights Watch: ...If a child isn't allowed to take a book out of a library and read it, what do they have it for? If that book is in a library any student can go and read it, then if he can't read it, who is allowed to read it?..The report quotes an east London teacher, Rob Faure Walker, who said: ...Numerous students have said that they are scared to talk openly with adults now .._ I have got no doubt that Prevent isolates Muslim students...A sixth-form student, identified only as Muniadiah, told Rights Watch she was scared to speak out because the promotion of ...British values.. made her worry that she might say ...something too extreme or someone might misunderstand .._ and report you to Prevent...The report also refers to previous controversial cases such as the four-year-old judged to be at risk of becoming a terrorist because ...a teacher thought his pronunciation of ...cucumber' sounded like ...cooker bomb'..; the child questioned for using the word ...l'.©coterrorisme.. in a French lesson discussing environmental tactics; and the 17-year-old referred to Prevent for expressing solidarity with Palestine after handing out leaflets highlighting water shortages in Gaza....At a time when effective and lawful counter-terrorism policies are more important than ever, the UK government's Prevent strategy is instead leaving a generation of young Britons fearful of exercising their rights to freedom of expression and belief,.. the director of Rights Watch UK, Yasmine Ahmed, said. ...Our research has found that Muslim children across the United Kingdom are self-censoring for fear of being reported under Prevent. Their fear is not unwarranted. We have uncovered a number of instances where children have been referred to Prevent for legitimately exercising their right to freedom of expression in situations where they pose no threat to society whatsoever...Rights Watch calls for the Prevent strategy in schools to be abandoned, however, in response to its report, a government spokesperson said: ...Schools should provide a safe space for debate and be places where young people can discuss any issue and develop the knowledge to see extremist ideologies for what they are and challenge them. The Prevent duty is about safeguarding children from extremist ideologies, not about shutting down debate ( to suggest otherwise is just wrong....Since 2011 more than 400,000 people, including teachers, have received training on how to recognise the signs of radicalisation and what steps they should take. Our recent teachers' omnibus survey shows the impact of that with 83% per cent of school leaders confident in how they should implement the Prevent duty. We have also published a range of advice and resource materials via our Educate Against Hate website...The Ofsted report, in contrast to that of Rights Watch, said: ...Too many providers see the Prevent duty as little more than a ...tick-box exercise' and do not regard it as an important part of their responsibilities towards learners...Paul Joyce, Ofsted's deputy director for further education and skills, said: ...It is concerning that in some colleges and providers the progress made in implementing the duty has been slow. It is worrying that inspectors saw examples of poor practice that I've no doubt would shock parents and learners alike...In one case highlighted by the report, a student was able to circumvent computer firewalls and access an Isis video showing a person being beheaded....The learner had been watching the video for some time before being challenged by a teacher walking through the [resource centre]. The teacher made the learner close the web page. The learner showed no remorse about what she had done. The learner received no support or counselling from the college and was not reprimanded in any way,.. the report said.Ofsted also found that six of the colleges had no arrangements to check the suitability of external speakers, while nine providers allowed external speakers to appear without following their own monitoring procedures.But Ofsted did praise some institutions for their efforts, including Luton sixth-form college for developing influential links with local groups as well as the borough council.David Corke, the director of education and skills policy at the Association of Colleges, said: ...Colleges have been working incredibly hard to implement the duty and they will continue to do so as the threat of radicalisation and terrorism is ever present...",1146,28.65,6.46,3.14,16.06,11.34,6.37,2.62,3.93,3.14,3.4,4.36,0.52,0.17,0.26,0,2.79,1,0

403,0,"Labour MPs hoping to remove Jeremy Corbyn from office have been dealt a major blow after the party's ruling body decided he did not need the support of colleagues to stand for the leadership again.The Labour leader's claim that he should automatically be on the ballot was passed by a margin of just four votes ( including his own ( in a fraught meeting of the National Executive Committee. The decision means that Mr Corbyn will battle Angela Eagle for the leadership in a brutal summer contest that MPs fear could split the party, pitting trade unions and Left-wingers against moderates.However, there was also a boost for Labour rebels after rules that allowed anyone to vote in the leadership contest last summer by paying just Σ3 were ditched. Instead the price has been increased to Σ25, while full-time members must have been affiliated to the party for at least six months to vote - barring the 100,000 new members who joined in recent weeks. The members of the NEC voted that Mr Corbyn should automatically be included on the leadership ballot by 18 to 14 following a heated meeting that lasted almost six hours. There was speculation on Tuesday night that the Labour Party could formally challenge the vote through the courts, though leading moderates played down the chances of that. Speaking to cheering supporters, Mr Corbyn effectively launched his re-election campaign by saying he would take his message of fighting inequality across the country to strengthen Labour. ...I'm delighted to say the Labour NEC has decided that the leader is automatically on the ballot paper,.. he said outside the central London office where the meeting had taken place. ...We will be campaigning on all the things that matter.._ That will strengthen our party in order to defeat this Tory government and bring in a government that cares for ordinary people...Labour rebels were left infuriated by the decision, claiming the trade unions that voted in favour of Mr Corbyn had ...done us over.. by propping him up. They also warned he did not have the ...moral authority.. to lead. They must now attempt to defeat a Labour leader who won an overwhelming majority from party members less than a year ago. The NEC meeting also saw Labour rebels and Corbyn supporters clash over whether he needed the backing of 51 MPs and MEPs to re-run for the Labour leadership. Both sides produced legal advice about the party rules as moderates argued he needed the backing of colleagues to run, while Corbyn allies said that was not necessary. At one point, Mr Corbyn was reportedly asked to step out of the room so those present could decide whether to hold a secret ballot. He was reported to have initially refused to do so ( although his office denied the claim.Labour rebels were offered hope when those present agreed to a secret ballot, giving Corbyn critics the cover to vote against their leader while remaining anonymous. Mr Corbyn's allies were prepared to seek an injunction against the Labour Party to delay the vote until a ruling on the dispute from the High Court.Sources close to the Labour leader also told the Telegraph that his office was considering whether it was worth Mr Corbyn resigning, lowering the bar of MP and MEPs' support he would need from 51 to 38.However, those considerations were not needed after it was announced that the NEC had voted with Mr Corbyn and decided he did not need the support of elected lawmakers to re-run for the leadership. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and Mr Corbyn's closest ally, said: ...Jeremy on the ballot, democracy prevails. We will use [the] leadership election to sign up even more members and prepare ground for General Election.""Ms Eagle, who triggered the contest this week, said: ...I am glad the NEC has come to a decision. I welcome the contest ahead and I am determined to win it.""Owen Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, who is also considering a leadership bid, will now come under pressure to put aside his ambitions and back Ms Eagle as a ...unity candidate... John McTernan, Tony Blair's former director of political operations, told Sky News that trade unions who voted with Mr Corbyn had ...stabbed the party in the heart... ...This is the end of the Labour Party, nothing more or less than that .._ the unions have destroyed the Labour Party,.. he said. Michael Dugher, the former shadow culture secretary and Corbyn critic, said: ...If you can't even get one in five of your own party in parliament to have confidence in you, what possible moral authority do you have?..Mr Corbyn said he hoped his opponents would not mount a legal challenge over the decision. Pledging to campaign ""on all the things that matter"", he said anyone who had any disagreements should ""come and talk about it"".Mr Corbyn said: ""I have been elected, last year, 10 months ago, with a very large mandate. I respect that mandate. It's a responsibility I'm carrying out.""I would hope there isn't going to be a legal challenge. There's been a very long legal discussion this afternoon. There were very well-qualified lawyers on hand to advise, so I think we are fine.""There was a buoyant response at a Keep Corbyn event in Kentish Town, north London, attended by more than 1,000 supporters of the Labour leader.

404,0,"Tom Watson's election as deputy leader of the Labour Party is even less surprising than Jeremy Corbyn's victory. It could yet prove to be at least as significant to the party's future.Even if you're not a student of Labour politics, you may be familiar with Mr Watson, thanks to his campaigning over historic allegations of sexual abuse by the powerful. Over the summer, as the police began looking into Ted Heath's conduct, Mr Watson could be heard talking about how he raised concerns about the former Tory prime minister several years ago. A cuddly fellow with sad eyes, Mr Watson works tirelessly in public to expose sexual abuse by those in positions of power and authority.But there is another Tom Watson, a Labour MP with a lower public profile but with great influence and support in his party and its local activists. He was backed for deputy leadership by 174 constituency Labour parties, more than twice the number backing his nearest rival, and more even than are supported Mr Corbyn, for the top job. A lethally efficient political fixer, Mr Watson works tirelessly behind the scenes to bring the Labour movement under his control.Together, these two Tom Watsons make up one of the most interesting and important figures in British politics today, as well as one of the least-acknowledged. While Corbynmania has gripped social media, people who do Labour politics in the real world know that Mr Watson's seemingly inevitable advance to the deputy leadership may yet matter more.During the leadership election, the New Statesman quoted a Labour insider talking about Mr Corbyn and Mr Watson as Trotsky and Stalin. It's an apt metaphor. Mr Corbyn is an ideologue and a thinker, while Mr Watson is an organiser who understands supremely well how to marshal and employ political power, sometimes to destructive effect. A mere junior minister in Tony Blair's government, in 2006 Mr Watson assembled and deployed the forces that drove Labour's most electorally successful leader from office the following year. From the opposition benches after 2010, he organised the campaign that closed the News of the World.His victory in the deputy leadership race owes much to organisation; some colleagues whisper that he started his campaign for the job two years ago, around the time he quit Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. The new Labour leader could find Deputy Watson a major check on his authority, a force to be bargained with. Some Labour MPs despairing over Mr Corbyn's victory hopefully predict his violent demise well before the general election, with Mr Watson's fingerprints carefully wiped off the icepick. Even some ardent Blairites are willing to forgive Mr Watson's assassination of the party's most successful leader in the hope that he rids Labour of its new one.The man himself has repeatedly talked down any prospect of a coup or conspiracy to oust Mr Corbyn, insisting that any new leader will deserve the support of the party. In a telling sign of how many of his colleagues view him and his future, Mr Watson has also had to repeatedly insist that he has no desire ever to serve as Labour's leader.What Mr Watson actually wants to do with the power he accumulates is rarely discussed. Some Tories who regard him as a simple trade union bovver boy (he shared a flat with Len McCluskey of Unite, and ran his deputy leadership campaign from a Unite office) lazily assume he's an unreconstructed lefty.In fact, he comes from the AEEU, the engineering union that was a cornerstone of the old Labour right wing and in the 1970s and 80s tried to hold the line against the militants and the acolytes of Tony Benn, the faction whose contemporary champion is, of course, Mr Corbyn. During his deputy leadership campaign, Mr Watson talked about the need for Labour to win back working-class voters from Ukip and the Tories by hardening its position on immigration. He wants bigger Armed Forces and a tougher approach to Vladimir Putin's Russia.Such realism was notably lacking from the Corbyn-dominated leadership contest, increasingly an auction of Left-wing fantasies. Mr Watson has no time for the purity of opposition. He knows politics is about power, that power comes from being in government, that getting back into government means defeating Labour's opponents, that Labour's biggest opponent is and always will be the Conservative Party.And that brings us back to Mr Heath, one of several senior Conservatives whose conduct Mr Watson has questioned as part of his campaign over child abuse.Mr Watson rejects utterly any suggestion that this campaign has any partisan dimension. He says he has ...shared intelligence with the police regarding politicians from at least three political parties including my own... But it is a fact that Mr Watson is a Labour politician whose actions have contributed to public suspicions (thus far unproven) that senior Conservatives committed or condoned child abuse. Whatever the motives behind them, one consequence of his actions is potential political benefit to the Labour Party.A similar point can be made about Mr Watson's campaign against Rupert Murdoch's newspapers over phone hacking and other wrongdoing, a campaign that did significant financial and reputational harm to an organisation that had been politically critical of Labour. Media analysts like Roy Greenslade of the Guardian suggest Mr Watson has taken less interest in allegations of hacking at the Labour-supporting Mirror newspapers.Personally, Mr Watson is gentle and even sensitive. He wears his big heart on his sleeve. His interests ( computer games, obscure indy rock ( are unashamedly geeky. Other weepy nerds might get bullied in the playground of life, but no one pushes Mr Watson around. Some of his Labour colleagues are frightened of him, literally frightened.Whenever interviewers put his fearsome reputation to him, he says he's baffled and even hurt by it. In another politician, that reaction would be disingenuous or even deceitful, but I suspect Mr Watson is genuine here, that he really doesn't think he's a bully or a fixer or any of the other unpleasant things he's been called and will be called again. I suspect he truly believes he's a good person trying to do the right thing, doing what must be done to make the world a better place. And that's what makes him so interesting, so formidable, and so dangerous.",1062,23.6,9.6,5.18,13.65,12.15,5.27,3.95,6.4,2.26,4.24,4.52,0,0.09,0,0,0.19,0,1

And the thousand of new recruits  who have joined the party since the referendum will have to pay that fee if they want to vote, because the executive has ruled only those who have been party members for at least six months will have an automatic right to vote.The move has been criticised by Mr Corbyn's supporters.James Schneider, a spokesman for the Corbyn-backing Momentum organisation, said the January 12 cut-off for securing a vote in the leadership poll was ""not fair"".Mr Schneider told the BBC: ""We've seen since the Brexit vote probably the largest surge in political party membership in this country's history, with almost 130,000 people joining the Labour Party and a great number of those joined on the basis that they would be able to vote in a future leadership election.""A 38Degrees petition set up immediately after decision was announced calling for a reversal has already gathered over 2,000 signatures.The petition, which was set up by Tim Longson, said: ""We believe that as this will disqualify up to 20% of the whole Labour party membership (around 100,000 members), and that this is unacceptable and misrepresentational (sic) of the democratic Labour membership will.""Failure to meet with this very reasonable request of such a huge body of members may possibly suggest that the NEC leadership is, in fact, deliberately trying to block the additional votes of the these 20%, indicating some bias.""Further, in light of the fact that has been strongly suggested that the vast majority of these new full Labour party members are backing Jeremy Corbyn, and would vote for an NEC team who would also lean that way, it would suggest this bias is directed against Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.""Mr Corbyn has said he is ""delighted"" by the result, and urged his critics to unite ""to offer an alternative to this Tory government"".A former political advisor to Tony Blair, Ian McTernan, said the victory for Mr Corbyn had set the party on course for a split and was ""the end of the Labour party, nothing more or less than that"".He said the Labour has ben been ""stabbed in the heart and killed by the Labour National Executive Committee.""  Mr Corbyn's backers had feared that the executive would force him to find 50 Labour MPs or MEPs ( a fifth of the parliamentary party ( prepared to sign his nomination papers before his name could go on to the ballot paper. The leader's support among fellow MPs has hit such a low point that it is unlikely that he would be able to find that many supporters in the Commons.Labour Party members and supporters who gave Mr Corbyn an overwhelming mandate nine months ago will now get a second chance to vote for him.But Ms Eagle, one of more than 60 members of Labour's front bench who resigned in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership, still thinks she has a chance. She said: ""I'm glad Labour's NEC has come to a decision. I welcome the contest ahead. And I am determined to win it.""A Labour MP supporting Angela Eagle told The Independent ""it's not impossible"" that she could defeat Corbyn. ""He only just won 50 per cent of the full members last time."" Owen Smith also threw his hat into the ring on Wednesday morning.If Corbyn did win, the MP said, there was no question of most MPs constructing an opposition around him. The MP said that the anti-Corbyn majority of MPs would not split to set up their own parliamentary leadership. ""I don't think anyone is thinking of that.""  The MP did not rule out another attempt at the leadership next year but said: ""If Jeremy is the leader we would be totally vulnerable to a general election. If you were Theresa May, we'd be completely on our backs, why wouldn't you?""You can't call Jeremy Corbyn unpopular and unelectable while fighting to keep him off a ballot because he's too popularDuring an interview on BBC's Newsnight, Ms Eagle refused to say whether a Corbyn victory would spell the end of Labour as we know it, saying she was ""not going to speculate about what will happen if I lose"".""I think it is important that we take the broad base of the Labour party with us,"" she said. ""We need to be an effective Labour party going forwards.""The anger which the dispute has generated has threatened to turn to violence far beyond the realms of simple party politics.A brick thrown through the window of Angela Eagle's constituency party office in Wallasey is assumed to have been a political act ( though Mr Corbyn has condemned all such actions, whether by his supporters or his political opponents.A meeting that Ms Eagle was due to address in a hotel in Luton had to be moved to a new venue at short notice after the hotel received threats. An obscene message was left on the phone in her Commons office. Her angela4leader Facebook page had been deluged with messages taunting her and showing support for Jeremy Corbyn.And dozens of Mr Corbyn's supporters had turned up outside Labour's Westminster headquarters to show support as the executive met to decide on the issue which threatened to cut Mr Corbyn's leadership short without so much as a vote.It all started because the Labour Party rule book specifies that when a sitting leader is challenged, any challenger must secure the nominations of at least one fifth of all Labour MPs and MEPs, a hurdle Angela Eagle crossed without difficulty before launching her bid for the leadership on Monday.The executive was presented with conflicting legal advice on whether the same rule applies to a sitting leader. Mr Corbyn adamantly claimed that he had an automatic right to stand and should not be required to seek any nominations.Two hours into a tense afternoon it appeared that the mood might be swinging against Mr Corbyn, when the executive decided by 17 votes to 15 to hold a secret ballot. The Labour leader was asked to leave the room while his case was discussed. At first he refused, but then agreed to wait in another room in the same building. He later went back into the meeting and took part in the vote.The executive had also been sent a letter from a solicitors' firm, Howe & Co., complaining that the meeting had been called at too short notice and putting the executive on ...the clearest notice.. that if they did not allow Mr Corbyn's name to go on the ballot automatically, they would face an injunction in a high court to get their decision reversed.",1329,27.12,9.26,4.29,14.6,14.22,4.36,2.63,4.74,2.18,3.69,3.24,0.3,0,0.08,0,2.56,1,0

Join us as we take a look at 5 of the oddest deaths so far.._1) Bowel lacerationsFollowing a 36 hour Pokemon hunting bender, Sicilian man Vincenzo Lamaste noticed that a wild Bulbasaur had appeared in the nearby vicinity. Wracked with exhaustion and delirium from being out in the sun for nearly two straight days, Lamaste grew frustrated at his inability to find the creature, before deciding that it must be inside him, somehow. Inserting his iPhone 6s plus into his rectum in a bid to nab the beastie, Vincenzo lacerated his large intestine and bled to death an hour later.2) Strolled into an ISIS training campHuge numbers of people have met their doom playing Pokemon GO! after wandering into traffic or off the edges of cliffs, but few have been as unlucky as Muhan Dishanmeel, a 26-year-old Iraqi man who carelessly wandered into an ISIS training camp on the outskirts of his home town while training up his Rattatta. It appears that Dishanmeel was at first welcomed by the ISIS fighters, who were themselves massive Pokemon fans, but things turned sour after Muhan beat them all in Pokecombat, leading to him getting his Pokehead cut Pokeoff.3) Bombed by droneSay what you want about the US drone program, it sure is inaccurate. After picking up what looked like a terrorist outside a small Afghan village, a drone pilot proceeded to blow the Pokeballs out of an unfortunate would-be Pokemon trainer.

The Republican Party is meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, this week to officially nominate its candidate. And the Democratic Party will meet in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the next week to do the same thing.You probably know that Americans voted in primary elections and caucuses in the past several months to help pick one candidate for each of the two major parties. Donald Trump won the most votes of all the Republican Party candidates, and Hillary Clinton had the most among the Democrats. So if we know who the two main candidates are, you might ask why you should be interested in the conventions.Chris Cillizza, a Washington Post reporter who has covered political conventions since 2000, says you may like the balloons and funny hats, but there's much more to get your attention.""This election is a reality show, late-night talk show and political campaign all rolled into one,"" he told KidsPost. ""Especially at the Republican convention in Cleveland, you never know who might take the stage to speak. Celebrities? Athletes? Celebrity athletes? It's must-see TV!""Long before television was invented, these large gatherings were a big deal. In the 1830s, when conventions began, voters didn't know in advance who would be the nominee. Sometimes the delegates had bitter disagreements. In 1860, the Democrats needed two conventions to choose candidate Stephen Douglas. Republicans that year picked Abraham Lincoln at a single convention, but on the third vote. The worst by far was the 1924 Democratic convention: 16 days and 103 votes before John W. Davis became the nominee.In 1968, there were intense arguments at the Democratic convention over the Vietnam War. But the bigger news happened outside the convention hall. Several thousand war protesters battled with police, and dozens on both sides were injured.In the past 40 years, conventions have had very little drama. There are usually a few dozen speakers to rally the delegates - and the TV viewers - around the nominee. There are votes on the party's platform, or priorities. And on the final day, the nominees give an acceptance speech that reveals what they believe about important issues.But this year seems to be different. Clinton opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders hasn't officially given up his campaign. He wants the Democratic Party to support his ideas.

439,0,"Whenever you feel like things are just too tough, remember what K2 has been through. The space robot formerly known as Kepler should have been put out of commission by a 2013 hardware failure, but some genius engineering gave it a second life. Instead of joining the ranks of defunct satellites and other space debris, the exoplanet-hunting spacecraft has kept doing what it does best: Sifting through heaps of glittering, distant stars to find the treasures that orbit around them.And on Tuesday, NASA announced a record-breaking haul: K2 has confirmed the existence of 104 planets outside our solar system. The find includes a group of four exoplanets orbiting the same star - a band of potentially rocky worlds that might be Earth-like.That's a drop in the bucket for the Kepler mission overall (the spacecraft has already confirmed more than 2,000 planets, many of them potentially habitable), but this is the largest dump of planetary confirmations made in the secondary K2 mission.For the first few years of its mission, Kepler used three of its reaction wheels to keep it centered precisely on a single swath of the night sky. It was looking for fluctuations in starlight - dims and flickers and winks - made by planets as they passed in front of the 150,000 stars in Kepler's field of vision. Then one of those reaction wheels failed. Without it, the spacecraft was unstable, and any outside force could knock it totally out of position.Instead of calling it quits, the mission scientists transitioned into a second wave of observation called K2, which started in 2014. K2 uses the physical power of the sun to keep Kepler from being unwieldy. The light from the sun acts as a virtual third reaction wheel, physically pushing against the craft's solar panels as the three physical reaction wheels push back. The tension keeps the telescope in place, but it has to be repositioned every 80 days to keep the solar forces hitting it in just the right place.Most of the ""new planets"" discovered by Kepler are just new analysis of data collected during Kepler's main mission. But the intrepid second mission occasionally has its own successes to celebrate.Some of the haul's most interesting planets - a quad of potentially rocky worlds about the same size as Earth - wouldn't even have been found without K2's unique handicaps.""Kepler's original mission observed a small patch of sky as it was designed to conduct a demographic survey of the different types of planets,"" Ian Crossfield, a Sagan Fellow at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, said in a statement. Crossfield is the lead author of the study announcing these newly confirmed worlds, published this week in Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series. ""This approach effectively meant that relatively few of the brightest, closest red dwarfs were included in Kepler's survey,"" he explained.Because small, cool red dwarfs are so common in the galaxy (they make up about 75 percent of the local star population), scientists think they might be a good place to look for life. They're old - meaning that planets around them have had plenty of time to evolve life of some sort - and we have a lot of them close by.""The K2 mission allows us to increase the number of small, red stars by a factor of 20, significantly increasing the number of astronomical 'movie stars' that make the best systems for further study,"" Crossfield said.The M dwarf star K2-72, which sits 181 light years away, fits that description: It's just half the mass of our own sun and not as bright. But because the four could-be-rocky worlds discovered around it orbit so close, some of them might be in the star's habitable zone, the range in which liquid water could be found.The planets were confirmed using follow-up observations from the North Gemini telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, the Automated Planet Finder of the University of California Observatories and the Large Binocular Telescope operated by the University of Arizona.

So students who are prone to losing their belongings -  like Ross who lost both her student card and bus pass the first week of school last year -  will save money through the new system.Previously, students who lost the package that contains both their student card and bus pass ended up paying $52 -  $27 for the student card and $25 for the bus pass replacement.Now students will only pay $31 for the new smart student card.

461,0,"Just four months ago, Amanda Farrell '16 was a peer liaison and a freshman counselor in Calhoun College, eating in Yale's dining halls, attending classes and occasionally reading the News.Now that she's graduated, Farrell still reads the News, but she does it at her desk in Woodbridge Hall in preparation for her daily briefing with Secretary and Vice President for Student Life Kimberly Goff-Crews.Farrell is one of 39 members of the class of 2016 who occupy a variety of professional roles at Yale, including at the Center for Clinical Investigation, the Investments Office, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and more than a dozen other University departments, according to preliminary survey data from the Office of Career Strategy. Farrell works for the Office of the Secretary and Vice President for Student Life as a Woodbridge Fellow, a one-year position created to give recent Yale graduates exposure to the inner workings of a university....They want us to look at everything we do with the insight of a recent student,.. Farrell said. ...We get asked for advice on any kinds of new projects the University is working on...Her career path isn't uncommon: Yale has been the top employer for graduating seniors every year since 2013, when the Office of Career Strategy began collecting data on what students were doing after graduation.And as these 39 students adjust to professional life in the place where they used to study, several themes arise that link their experiences: an inside look at Yale, the community a university provides and the chance to explore a familiar city through a new lens.Daniel Hwang '16, who works in the Finance Office, said learning about the administrative decisions made at Yale and financial factors that drive them has changed the way he sees the college. Likewise, Farrell said she has developed a new appreciation for the many University administrators who work outside of the spotlight.Grant Bronsdon '16, a former Sports editor for the News who now works in the Admissions Office, said Yale was a great place to transition from student to young professional given that employees are still a part of the Yale community....I like being on campus and being able to enjoy the campus environment, while still having a life and a career that is separate from being an undergrad,.. Bronsdon said.Bronsdon added that he is now able to explore New Haven and its surrounding area much more, since many of his coworkers have cars and take day-trips to nearby towns like North Haven.Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jeremiah Quinlan said his office, which is known for hiring recent Yale graduates, benefits from having younger employees with intimate knowledge of current campus life....They can just do such a great job talking about their Yale experience, and reflecting on that experience to help better inform the admissions process,.. Quinlan said.The recent graduates differ in their engagement with undergraduates. Bronsdon has younger friends who remain on campus, some of whom he lives with, and he often has dinner around New Haven with his friends who are still students. He also remains active in residential college life: Apart from his work in the Admissions Office, Bronsdon mentors two freshmen in Ezra Stiles.Farrell, however, chooses to keep her distance from the residential colleges and other student-dominated spaces, though she said it's only to keep herself from growing nostalgic and to create a Yale experience separate from the one she had as an undergraduate.Hwang said the timing of professional life keeps him from interacting from more students....It's an interesting code switch,.. Hwang said. ...I'm up and biking to work earlier than most students are waking up, and getting back from work at a time most students are at dinner, so I don't see students very much...Like Bronsdon, Hwang still keeps in touch with friends who are still at Yale, but he said lack of access to the residential colleges and dining halls makes interacting with students harder, since that's where most students take a break from their schedules to socialize.Though some new Yale employees felt they had an inside look at the workings of the University, they also have less access to Yale in certain ways, foregoing the privileges that undergraduates take for granted....The biggest thing that's strange is when all the benefits of being a student are swiftly yanked away, like gym access, swipe access to just about all the buildings and dining halls,.. Hwang said.",754,30.16,8.75,4.91,16.71,12.86,4.51,4.11,5.31,0.27,3.32,5.7,0.4,0,0,0,1.86,0,0

No injuries were reported.The southeastern end of Daggett Street was taped off, and police cars were placed on each end of the street while detectives canvassed the area, including houses and bushes on either side of the street. The police began to take down the tape at 2:30 p.m. and declared the area clear minutes later. According to detectives on scene, nothing suspicious was discovered, but the investigation is ongoing.Yale sent multiple alerts about the incidents, first warning the campus community to avoid the area and then advising that the area had been cleared.A witness, who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic, reported the shooting to the police when he heard eight shots being fired while washing his car in the driveway. According to the witness -  who has been a resident of Daggett Street for more than two decades -  the safety of the neighborhood has deteriorated in recent years.

463,0,"The Yale Dramatic Association has cast a white woman in a role traditionally been played by a black man for the organization's flagship fall show, ...Wild Party,.. drawing widespread criticism from the theater community.The role of Mr. Black, who falls for the main character Queenie at a party, will be played by Sarah Chapin '17. Two black students were cast in the show: Nickolas Brooks '17 as Eddie the Thug, a boxer, and Madi Cupp-Enyard '20 as Jackie the Dancer.About 75 people -  including only nine students of color -  auditioned for the show, which has 14 cast members. The Dramat, which has drawn criticism for the decisions since posting the cast list Monday, held an open conversation Thursday night, inviting students to voice their concerns.Producer Jill Carrera '17 said the casting decision was prompted by the low number of black actors who auditioned, but acknowledged that outreach efforts to students of color fell short....Ultimately it came down to our original vision for the show and the outreach that I did,.. Carrera told the News after Thursday night's meeting. ...We didn't get the people we needed to make that vision a reality, so my director went back and he re-visioned the entire show with the people we had in the room, and that was ultimately where the casting decision came from...Dianne Lake '16, who attended Thursday's forum and has acted in Dramat performances in the past, said the organization has a reputation for casting shows with white leads, and that the shows that do feature actors of color tend to be given less weight and attention. ...Wild Party.. could have been the group's chance to break from that mold, she said....The problem has multiple prongs. It has to do with recruiting and making an effort to reach out to people of color on campus, but also has to do with selecting what plays [the Dramat] chooses and what roles are available to people of color,.. Lake said. ...The problem is one of systematic persistence, with the same type of plays being put on, with the same type of people being cast...Students interviewed noted that discrimination within the theater community reaches far beyond just the show's casting decision and includes the Dramat's limited outreach to students of color. Brooks said undergraduate programs to develop theater skills among communities of color would help students overcome socioeconomic barriers, which may have prevented those with raw talent from honing their skills earlier on. Playing roles like ...Eddie the Thug.. puts actors of color in difficult positions of portraying stereotypes about their race and gender on stage, he said.Donald Woodson '16, who last fall directed ...Exception to the Rule,.. a show produced and cast entirely by people of color, said the short casting cycle for freshmen at the beginning of the year provides an unfair advantage to students from performing arts high schools. Many students of color do not go into theater until later on in their careers, he said, and workshops would help to level the uneven playing field.Dramat members released a statement saying that as a board and as individuals, they were grateful for the feedback from the Yale community over the past few days. The statement said the board will meet to discuss Thursday night's conversation and determine the ...next steps regarding ...Wild Party' and our organization as a whole...This week was not the first time students have voiced such concerns about the Dramat. Woodson said that the same white actors are recast repeatedly in lead roles while people of color are relegated to supporting roles as maids and servants. He added that until last semester, the Dramat had only put up one show written by a black playwright -  in 1995. Woodson said the group also decided in the past to put on a show with all Latinx characters with an almost exclusively white cast.Lake told the News that in soliciting actors for this show, the Dramat reached out to a capella groups, which tend to be predominantly white. A capella groups are among the first talent pools contacted because they have more people who have done musicals before, she said, thus creating an ...insular world......It's up to not only theater-makers at Yale, but also non-theater-makers, to call the Dramat out and hold them accountable for the decisions that they make, because they really do reflect Yale as a whole,.. Woodson said. ...The race issues going on are symptomatic and emblematic of the issues all around campus...The Yale Dramatic Association was founded in 1900.",768,26.48,6.77,2.86,16.28,12.5,4.95,2.86,4.04,0.91,3.91,5.08,0.13,0,0,0,3.26,1,0
464,0,"n November 2015, Molly Montgomery '19 slept an average of four hours a night. After two weeks of this routine, 20 minutes into a seminar, her body finally gave out. Fully conscious of what was happening, but unable to fight her exhaustion any longer, Montgomery fell asleep while sitting directly across from her professor.Although she said the embarrassment of this incident prompted her to get more rest, Montgomery clocked an average of only six hours a night for the remainder of the semester -  still lower than the medically recommended seven to nine nightly hours of sleep.The National Sleep Foundation recommends that college-aged adults sleep between 49 and 63 hours a week. However, last semester, the Yale College Council Health Task Force reported that the average Yale student sleeps only 6.7 hours on a weekday night during the semester -  a total of only 33.5 hours a week, excluding weekends. The report also found that more than one in 10 Yalies clock five hours or less on an average weekday night.Yale is not alone. College students are one of the most sleep-deprived demographics in America, according to the National Institutes of Health. In a 2015 study published in the Sleep Health Journal -  the official journal of the National Sleep Foundation -  it was found that 70 to 96 percent of college students are sleeping less than eight hours a night.And new studies have proven sleep deprivation to be even more dangerous than thought before. Sleep loss has been linked with obesity, abnormal blood lipids, cardiovascular disease, breast and prostate cancer, worsening of cognitive impairment, mood disorders and many other medical conditions.But is it impossible to succeed at this institution without giving up sleep? Interviews with students and experts have found that the causes of Yale's sleep deprivation problem lie not just in students' full schedules and heavy course loads, but in a culture which glorifies sleep deprivation as an intrinsic and unavoidable component of the Yale experience -  even in the absence of extreme academic or extracurricular pressure.IS SNOOZING REALLY LOSING?According to a 2000 study published in the ...Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine,.. staying awake for 17 hours -  and leaving only seven hours for sleep -  results in cognitive impairment equivalent to a blood alcohol content of 0.05 percent. After 21 hours awake, a person's cognitive impairment can reach the equivalent of a 0.08 percent BAC -   the legal driving limit in Connecticut.Meir Kryger, director of the Yale Sleep Center, described the current level of sleep deprivation at Yale as a ...serious health issue... This fall semester Kryger is teaching a residential college seminar entitled ...The Mystery of Sleep...According to Kryger, students' lack of awareness regarding the effects of sleep deprivation is potentially as dangerous as the deprivation itself, because students who try to act normally following a period of insufficient sleep put themselves and others in danger.Lack of sleep impairs fundamental bodily functions such as concentration, judgment and reaction time, Kryger said, endangering undergraduates even if they are not behind the wheel.Yale School of Medicine professor Christine Won described sleep deprivation at Yale as a ...rampant problem... Won, who joined the Yale faculty in 2009, added that although it has always been an issue at the University, sleep deprivation has not been recognized or appreciated.However, experts interviewed suggested that the chronic results of sleep deprivation can be just as dangerous as the short-term consequences. In particular, Kryger highlighted weight gain, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and psychological risks, including increased chances of developing a mood disorder.Won said that those who routinely deprive themselves of sleep often have lower life expectancies than those who maintain healthier schedules, adding that sleep-deprived students also run the serious risk of sleep attacks: intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. She added that because the longer-term effects of sleep deprivation often do not appear until later in life, it is easier for college-aged students to compensate for lack of sleep while they are young.Rafael Pelayo, a Stanford University School of Medicine professor who co-teaches a popular undergraduate course titled ...Sleep and Dreams.. at the university in Palo Alto, said the mixture of sleep deprivation with other potentially dangerous activities on college campuses, such as alcohol and drug abuse, is a further cause for concern....When people are sleep deprived they are more prone to effects of alcohol,.. Pelayo said. ...Sleep deprivation will augment the effects of alcohol. So if [college students] have been staying up late during the week and want to celebrate at the weekend, then you're compounding [the effects of] sleep deprivation and alcohol...",778,25.1,5.53,1.54,15.3,8.74,6.04,2.96,8.23,5.27,3.73,5.4,0.13,0,0.26,0,1.8,0,0
465,0,"Amid persistent allegations of sexual harassment and abuse of power within the Spanish and Portuguese Department, Spanish professor Roberto Gonz.lez Echevarr._a GRD '70 -  who has been at the heart of many of the allegations -  is not at Yale this term, although no public explanation of his absence has been given.Gonz.lez Echevarr._a's absence has become something of a taboo subject within a department already plagued by confusion and secrecy, according to faculty members, graduate students and undergraduates interviewed. The professor's two undergraduate courses, one about ...Don Quixote.. and the other about Spanish Golden Age theater, were unexpectedly canceled from online course offerings in late August, with no explanation given to students or staff. The Provost's Office sent a confidential memo on Aug. 31 to the ladder faculty in the Spanish and Portuguese and Comparative Literature Departments, in which Gonz.lez Echevarr._a holds appointments, although professors interviewed would only confirm the existence of the memo, not its contents or whether it addressed Gonz.lez Echevarr._a's one-semester leave of absence.The controversy surrounding Gonz.lez Echevarr._a, a professor renowned for his scholarship in Spanish literature, first emerged in March 2015, when an anonymous group of graduate students wrote a letter to the department and University administrators decrying the allegedly negative atmosphere and abuse of power within the department. The letter singled out Gonz.lez Echevarr._a, accusing him of sexual harassment.The department has also struggled in the past two admissions cycles, not matriculating a single new graduate student. The department's youngest graduate students are currently in their third year, meaning they have already finished their graduate coursework. Professors in the department were told this spring to adjust their teaching schedules as they would only be teaching undergraduate courses.In response to the department's struggles, University administrators announced in spring 2015 a broad review of the department, which led to changes such as a mandatory sexual harassment training session for the department's faculty members and the arrival of an external director of graduate students. However, the review did not recommend any disciplinary action against faculty members, and administrators never publicly linked the sexual harassment training to the allegations against Gonz.lez Echevarr._a.Now, his unexplained absence has left some students searching for answers but afraid to ask for them....I wanted to take one or even two of [Gonz.lez Echevarr._a's] classes, so the cancellations really left a big hole in my schedule,.. said an undergraduate Spanish major, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. ...I have asked a couple of professors and they avoided the topic. In this department, you can't ask certain things or people might get mad or offended. The information is so contained but it affects everyone...Two undergraduate Spanish majors and two graduate students in the department interviewed said they did not know why Gonz.lez Echevarr._a was taking a leave of absence, although they had all heard about the previous allegations against the professor.One Spanish undergraduate major said there is a sense that the Gonz.lez Echevarr._a's absence is a ...hidden.. topic, as faculty members the student has reached out to either did not know the situation or could not talk about it.A department source knowledgeable about the situation, who also requested anonymity, said that the provost's memo was ...strictly confidential... The source said the administration's lack of transparency in addressing issues in the department is ironic, as the department's opaque decision-making process is one of the issues that caused the initial discontent and subsequent review....I think the University administration is creating more problems for itself by adopting such an absurdly secretive policy,.. the source said.The cancellation of the two courses has also caused logistical difficulties. The source noted that the changes mean that upper-level seminars have to take in many more students than is usually allowed.Various administrators interviewed confirmed Gonzalez Echevarria's leave of absence but declined to comment further. Department Chair Rolena Adorno said Gonzalez Echevarria will return to teaching in the spring.Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Tamar Gendler said faculty members take leaves of absences for a variety of reasons, but said she could not comment further on specific cases out of respect for the privacy of faculty members.",699,25.89,5.87,2.72,13.45,10.73,5.72,3.58,3.86,2,3.86,4.58,0,0,0,0,1.72,1,0

It wasn't even lunchtime and already my stomach was looking like a Rothko painting thanks to a combination of UV rays and high-waisted shorts. I waited until as many people as possible were either sleeping or too deep in books or salt water to notice, and then ( having worked out the shortest possible path from deckchair to sea ( scuttled awkwardly into the ocean.Embarrassment is the last thing you want to feel when on holiday, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels ashamed of not conforming to the ideal standard of ...beach-ready' that rears its ugly head each year as summer approaches. Of course, if you take one look at the actual beach bodies belonging to the actual beach people on the actual beach, you will see a representative of almost every possible size and shape. This idea that to set foot on a beach you have to look like Gigi Hadid is obviously ridiculous but somehow remains powerful, no matter how much we joke about it and condemn it.The idea of the perfect beach body is not only toxic, feeding insecurities and fostering unrealistic goals, but nonsensical. Beach bodies are supposed to be thin, toned, smooth  and tanned (but all too often white as well). So when do you need it by? Six weeks? Two weeks? Anything is possible, the fitness gurus and workout guides tell us, with enough stomach crunches.The feeling that you don't look how you're supposed to look is very real, but, like the photoshopped limbs of a Victoria's Secret model, it is also imaginary ( the result of a collective idea of perfection that is, ironically, only natural in the world we live in. Shame is the product, nurtured by advertising campaigns and the squawking headlines of celebrity gossip magazines. A beach body sounds like something you've got to have, like it's the hot summertime trend that won't die, like you can pay for one in salads and trips to the gym. Maybe you can, but that doesn't mean you ought to feel like you should.The beach is not an episode of America's Next Top Model ( you're not being judged, and you don't need to fit a beauty ideal to have fun.

473,0,"Neoliberalism, the political ideology that has dominated the west and most of the world since the late 1970s, is on its deathbed. In Britain, the Brexit victory and the likely ascendancy of Corbyn in the Labour leadership election are the result of the discontent with the current political and economic system. The truth is that the economic crisis of 2008 has never really ended. For most British people, real wages have fallen and multiple generations are facing the fact they will be worse off than their parents and grandparents. This leaves neoliberalism, the belief that the free market can provide the solution to problems previously handled by the state, in the lurch. Neoliberalism called for a shrinking of the state and an expansion of the market. All three major political parties in the UK bought into neoliberalism to greater or lesser extents. In many ways, politics was subordinate to the market, political leaders became increasingly concerned with catering to markets by providing stability and certainty. As the realm of the state shrank so did politics in general. Political parties refused to move outside the paradigm of neoliberalism; political party membership and voter turnout declined. Voters saw political parties were unwilling to move out of their ...establishment' positions, on issues from nationalisation to immigration. Anti-establishment political movements from Trump to Corbyn are a direct response to this narrowness and inability of the politicians to think outside the box of neoliberalism. Trump draws support from an anti-globalisation working class who have seen secure jobs go abroad and found no representation through either the Republicans or the Democrats. Corbyn's support is from a whole host of different groups, all disillusioned by Blair's New Labour and the lack of any real alternative. The writing is on the wall for neoliberalism: free markets, free movement and privatisation can no longer be unquestionably called ...common sense', as Thatcher and Reagan's policies were in the 1980s.But I can't help but feel that the decline of neoliberalism is not a cause to celebrate. The rise of inequality, certainly, is inexcusable. But the beauty of this market fundamentalism is that it avoided the conflicts that we are now facing. By shrinking the state's role in almost every aspect of our lives, it became not politics, but the market, that mattered.Take open immigration policies between countries, an essential neoliberal idea. In the neoliberal paradigm this is controlled by the supply and demand within the labour market. What matters is not race, religion or nationality of an immigrant, but their skills ( and within the EU, even this doesn't matter. Neoliberalism, however flawed, kept us away from conceptions of politics like Trump's economic nationalism, where religion becomes legitimate grounds for barring someone's entry into the country. To pure neoliberalism, only wealth matters, thus it is incompatible with overt nationalism or overt racism. Yet its downfall is not bringing a ...kinder, gentler politics', but the type of politics where an MP is murdered by a fascist.From 1979 to today ...common sense' has been austerity, free trade and privatisation. Increasingly, banning immigrants based on religion and economic nationalism are touted as the ...common sense' solutions to our problems.

Beyonc.© is a consummate performer, tenaciously private in her personal life, and rarely seems to give anything away. But the woman on stage at Glasgow's Hampden Park Stadium, whilst clearly a queen, was more than happy to show herself in many lights to her loyal subjects. From start to finish, she was rarely off stage for more than a minute or two to change costume, staying with us even while her dancers disappeared for a song or two. She smiled, she laughed, she brushed her fingers against the hands of her adoring standing fans ( and she constantly thanked the audience, inviting us all to be flawless, to be survivors, and to revel in her music, both classic and new. After kicking off with the strong beat of ""ormation', she segued into a slower set, finishing one of the acts with ...All Night', which she claims is her favourite song from the new album, Lemonade. But it is Beyonc.©'s raw power we love most, and one of the best sequences of the night saw her striding out of a gigantic screen, which split in two, and stomping toward the front of the stage, ready to snarl her way through Lemonade's most acidic track, ...Don't Hurt Yourself', dressed in a floor length cape with a cobra on the back. Then a throne appeared so that she could sit down ( only for a minute ( to give an unrecognisably bad ass version of ...Ring the Alarm' before her other dancers joined her for vintage hit ...Diva' while the words 'female' ...hustler' and ...boss' were projected in massive white letters on the screen behind her.The visual element, so key to her last two albums successes, was integrated well into the show: dramatic clips of Beyonc.© floating in a glass box while she recited Warsan Shire's poetry (which she used in the latest album) later flickered into family home footage, an oddly touching moment.But the most moving point of the night came when the names of all those destroyed by police brutality flashed up on the screen. Beyonc.© came down the runway and asked for a moment of silence before performing the first verse and chorus of ""reedom' acapella. Even whilst singing along, it was clear to me that the words ...I need freedom too' were not meant for the predominantly white audience Beyonc.© was singing to. But that feeling was important too, making us aware of a divide, and forcing the crowd to think about what we could do to change it. The power of the finale ( ""reedom' to ...Survivor' to ...Halo' ( showcased the two traits Beyonc.©'s tour seeks most to embody: strength and grace. The state of forgiveness and redemption, in the face of infidelity whether autobiographical or imagined, resonates just as loudly as the very real anger and call to arms evident in her renditions of ""reedom' and ...Survivor'. My main feeling on leaving the concert was that I could spend all my money on concert tickets, but Queen Bey's iconic power remains something that money cannot buy. We can only afford to see a piece of it on amazing nights like this. ",541,30.06,10.72,7.21,17.93,10.17,6.47,3.33,5.91,1.11,3.14,5.91,0.37,0,0.18,0,2.59,0,0

After a New York chapter of Black Lives Matter hosted a ‘blacks-only’ Memorial Day party, Tucker Carlson asked a BLM supporter why such an event is acceptable.
Carlson said the party promoted segregation – the exact thing BLM purports to oppose.
“I thought the whole point of Black Lives Matter was to speak out against singling out people based on race?” Carlson asked political commentator Lisa Durden.
“Boo-hoo, you white people are angry because you couldn’t use your ‘white privilege’ card to get invited to the Black Lives Matter all-black Memorial Day celebration,” Durden said.

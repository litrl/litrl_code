A roommate of Elizabeth Warren’s from college released this photo of her and a bunch of her “pagan friends” dancing around a tribute to the Gods of Wind and Fire:
The roommate, a hairdresser from Methuen named Francesca, said Warren was “flat-chested and awkward but always looked like she was having fun.” She added that marijuana, magic mushrooms, peyote and LSD were common at the rituals.
This is the kind of thing Warren would love to see disappear so let’s make it go viral, shall we?
